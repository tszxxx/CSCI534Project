well I pick out a tree 
and I tie it to the car 
there be a wreath up on we door 
eight tiny reindeer in the yard 
I drive under the downtown light 
Red an' green and blue 
the silver neon snowflake 
only make I think of you 
it be Christmas all around I 
you be in someone else 's land 
so I be send out my only wish 
hey Santa tell the man 
hey mister 
send my baby home 
this December 
I do not want to be all alone 
oh Christmas in America 
I need you in my arm 
far away from harm 
send my baby home 
I hear someone sing Jingle Bells 
no wait that be deck the Halls 
and the teenager with candy cane 
ramble through the mall 
the girl be down at Ruby 's 
try to find some Christmas cheer 
there be not much to do but drink too much 
when every day be unclear 
so here I be on Christmas Eve 
this silent holy night 
and I reach up to the star for you 
I pray that you be alright 
hey mister 
send my baby home 
this December 
I do not want to be all alone 
oh Christmas in America 
I need you in my arm 
far away from harm 
Mister send my baby home 
what happen to the peace on Earth 
all that goodwill toward man 
oh come on all ye faithful 
it be time to think again 
hey mister 
send my baby home 
this December 
I do not want to be all alone 
oh come on come on come on 
hey mister 
send my baby home 
this December 
I do not want to be all alone
