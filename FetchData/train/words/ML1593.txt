I finally find the love of a lifetime a love to last my whole life through I finally find the love of a lifetime Forever in my heart I finally find the love of a lifetime with every kiss , we love be like brand new and every star up in the sky be make for I and you still we both know that the road be long we know that we will be together because we love be strong
