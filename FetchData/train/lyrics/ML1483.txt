[Verse 1]
If I could give you the world
On a silver platter
Would even matter? You'd still be mad at me
If I can find in all this a dozen roses
Which I would give to you, you'd still be miserable
In reality I'm gon' be who I be
And I don't feel no faults for all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may bring me down when I say
That it ain't up to you, go on do what you do
[Chorus]
Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(Go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got I paid for
You can hate on me
[Verse 2]
Ooh if I gave you peaches out of my on garden
And I made you a peach cobbler, would you slap me?
I wonder if I gave you diamonds out of my own womb
Would you feel the love in that or ask "Why not the moon?"
If I gave you sanity for the whole of humanity
Had all the solutions for the pain and pollution
No matter where I live, despite the things I give
You'll always be this way, so go ahead and
[Chorus]
Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(Go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got I paid for
You can hate on me
Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(Go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got I paid for
You can hate on me
[Bridge]
You cannot hate on me
Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
You cannot hate on me
Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
You cannot hate on me
Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
You cannot hate on me
Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
[Chorus]
Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(Go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got I paid for
You can hate on me
