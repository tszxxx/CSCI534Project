Friends come a dime a dozen 
but I know that I will never find a friend like you 
and that be why I want to sing this song 
wherever you be 
wherever 
I just want to let you know 
that I will never lie again 
I promise 
I will never lie again 
cause you will always be my friend 
I will never lie again 
cause a friend like you will last forever 
sit in my window I be think of you 
all the fun thing we use to do 
I feel the pain please come back to I 
cause a friend like you will only come once in a lifetime 
I will never lie again 
cause you will always be my friend 
I will never lie again 
cause a friend like you will last forever 
on the phone when you be here 
laugh and joke cry and sulking 
in my dream you be still with I 
cause a friend like you only come once in a lifetime 
I will never lie again 
cause you will always be my friend 
I will never lie again 
cause a friend like you will last forever 
when I think of you I think of someone special 
and how it use to be yeah 
I know you will always be my friend 
I be so sad it have to end 
I will never lie again 
cause you will always be my friend 
I will never lie again 
cause a friend like you will last forever 
I will never lie again 
cause you will always be my friend 
I will never lie again 
cause a friend like you will last forever 
I will never lie again 
cause you will always
