[Verse 1]
I'll be coming home
Just to be alone
'Cause I know you're not there
And I know that you don't care
I can hardly wait
To leave this place
[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not our home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better of alone
[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a home
[Verse 2]
By the time you come home
I'm already stoned
You turn off the TV
And you scream at me
I can hardly wait
Til you get off my case
[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not our home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better of alone
[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a home
[Bridge]
I'm better off alone
[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not our home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better of alone
[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a
Home, home
This house is not a home
