if a picture paint a thousand word then why can not I paint you ? the word will never show the you I have come to know if a face could launch a thousand ship then where be I to go ? there 's no one home but you you be all that 's leave I too and when my love for life be run dry you come and pour yourself on I if a man could be two place at one time I would be with you Tomorrow and today beside you all the way if the world should stop revolve spin slowly down to die I would spend the end with you and when the world be through then one by one the star would all go out then you and I would simply fly away
