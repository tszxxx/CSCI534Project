Joy to the world the Lord be come 
let earth receive she king 
let every heart prepare he room 
and Heaven and nature sing 
and Heaven and nature sing 
and Heaven and Heaven and nature sing 
Joy to the world the Savior reign 
let all they song employ 
while field and flood rock hill and plain 
repeat the sounding joy 
repeat the sounding joy 
repeat repeat the sounding joy 
Joy unspeakable joy 
a overflow well no tongue can tell 
Joy unspeakable joy 
rise in my soul never let I go 
he rule the world with truth and grace 
and make the nation prove 
the glory of he righteousness 
and wonder of he love 
and wonder of he love 
and wonder wonder of he love 
Joy unspeakable joy 
a overflow well no tongue can tell 
Joy unspeakable joy 
rise in my soul never let I go
