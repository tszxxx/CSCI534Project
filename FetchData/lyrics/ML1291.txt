[Verse 1]
When I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me
[Chorus]
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
[Verse 2]
I look around me and feel
You are ever so close to me
Each tear that falls from my eye
Brings back memories of you to me
[Chorus]
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
[Bridge]
I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You alone, you alone and no one else
You were meant for me
Oh
[Verse 3]
When morning comes again
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by until finally
My time descends on me
[Chorus]
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
