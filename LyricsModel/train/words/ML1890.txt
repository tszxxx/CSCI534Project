long long and lonely night 
I cry my eye out over you 
wondrr if I do right 
and why you leave I with a broken heart 
oh long long and lonely night 
oh how I miss you my dear 
please please come back to I 
how I wish you be here 
as I go along my lonely way 
I visualize you face 
when I pass through my doorway 
what be leave for I to face 
oh long long and lonely night 
I guess you be never come home 
long long and lonely night 
ever since you have be go 
as I go along my lonely way 
I visualize you face 
when I pass through my doorway 
what be leave for I to face 
oh long long and lonely night 
I guess you be never come home 
long long and lonely night 
ever since you have be go 
please please come back to I 
you have be go too long
