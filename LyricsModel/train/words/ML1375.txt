until the philosophy 
which hold one race superior 
and another inferior 
be finally and permanently 
discredite and abandon 
everywhere be war 
until there be no longer first class 
or second class citizen of any nation 
that until the color of a man 's skin 
be of no more significance 
than the color of he eye 
I have get to say war 
that until the basic human rights 
be equally guarantee to all 
without regard to race 
then we say war 
that until that day the dream of last peace 
world citizenship and the rule of 
international morality will remain 
just a fleeting illusion to be pursue 
but never obtain 
and everywhere be war 
war in the east 
war in the west 
war up north 
war down south 
there will be war 
and the rumor of war 
that until the ignoble and unhappy regime 
which hold we sister in Africa yeah 
Africa yeah 
sub- human bondage have be topple 
utterly destroy 
everywhere be war 
and until that day 
the african continent 
will not know peace 
we Africans will fight we find it necessary 
and we know we shall win 
cause we be confident 
in the victory 
of good over evil 
good over evil 
good over evil
