Underneath the darkened sky
Drifting through a sea of lies
Pulled into the under tow
My body dragged deep below
...
Give me strength to push on through
GIVE ME STRENGTH!
Seeking shelter from the storm
"carry me when i can't go on
Uplift my spirit
So i carry on
, was once lost
But now im found
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn 
Push on through
FIGHT FOR LIFE!"
FIGHT FOR LIFE!"
MY WORD
IS NOT WITH FEAR
BUT WITH THE SPIRIT
IN UNREST
I fear no man
I fear not death
I fear no man
I will prevail
Give me strenght to carry on
Push on through the light of dawn
"carry me when i can't go on
Uplift my spirit
So i carry on
, was once lost
But now im found
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn 
Push on through
FIGHT FOR LIFE!"
FIGHT FOR LIFE!"
Push on through
FIGHT FOR LIFE!"
Push on through
FIGHT FOR LIFE!"
Push on through
