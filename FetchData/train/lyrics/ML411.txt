[Verse 1]
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
[Verse 2]
Bittersweet memories
That's all I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need
[Chorus]
But I will always love you
I will always love you
[Bridge]
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
