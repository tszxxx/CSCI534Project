[Verse 1]
Hear me spit on you, wither I
Remold into gold and bury I from sun
Reborn, left to sigh
Recure, maybe I'll
Be born and simplify
The way I lie, before
[Chorus 1]
I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I'm bored
[Verse 2]
Revered by you
And trust to figure out
I burn that gift to you, doll
And let it shine before
[Chorus 2]
I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I wish for a real one
[Verse 3]
Fit and confide
Before me, or I
I will come clean, it gets worse
It's more
[Chorus 2]
I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I wish for a real one
I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I wish for a real one
