I do not love you anymore like the way I do before 
and since you have find someone new I think it be best 
I do not try and walk the floor I do not love you anymore 
trouble be I do not love you any less 
I do not love you anymore for I have get no more love to give 
you drain my heart of all it be love with every sweet caress 
I keep say o'er and o'er I do not love you anymore 
trouble be I do not love you any less 
instrumental 
I hold you close to I one time I kiss you lip and call you mine 
but another come and thrilled you more I guess 
I cry as you walk out the door I do not love you anymore 
trouble be I do not love you any less 
I do not love you anymore for I have get no more love to give 
you drain my heart of all it be love with every sweet caress 
I keep say o'er and o'er I do not love you anymore 
trouble be I do not love you any less 
trouble be I do not love you any less
