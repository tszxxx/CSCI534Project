London's burnin'! London's burnin'!
All across the town, all across the night
Everybody's drivin' with full headlights
Black or white ya' turn it on, ya' face the new religion
Everybody's sittin' 'round watching television!
London's burnin' with boredom now
London's burning dial 99999
London's burnin' with boredom now
London's burnin' dial 99999
I'm up and down the Westway, in and out the lights
What a great traffic system, it's so bright
I can't think of a better way to spend the night
Than speedin' around underneath the yellow lights
(Chorus)
Now 
I'm in the subway
 and I'm lookin' for the flat
This one leads to this block, this one leads to that
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home
I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone
(Chorus)
(Here we go)
(inaudible shouting)
London's burnin'!
