[Verse 1: Sting]
If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
[Verse 2: Sting]
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
[Bridge: Sting]
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
[Verse 3: Sting]
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
[Outro: Sting]
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
