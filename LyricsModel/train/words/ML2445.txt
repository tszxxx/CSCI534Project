when he be just a little boy 
he only have one favourite toy 
and he have nothing on he mind 
he never leave anything behind

as he get older thing get worse 
like he would be bear under a curse 
thing start to fall apart 
they be not like they be at the start 
no it be like a civil war 
Grow up 
it be like a civil war 
do not turn away 
it be something you can not ignore 
Grow up 
it be like a civil war 
and now that he be in he teens 
he would start to learn what life mean 
problem be still appear 
they do not look like disappear 
no it be like a civil war 
Grow up 
it be like a civil war 
do not turn away 
it be something you can not ignore 
Grow up 
Grow up 
it be like a civil war 
do not turn away 
it be something you can not ignore 
Grow up

do not turn away 
it be something you can not ignore 
Grow up
