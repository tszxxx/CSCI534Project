I find the love I have be look for 
it be a real love it be a real love 
stand up behind a electric guitar 
it be a real love it be a real love 
and all the time I be think no way 
and all the time I never think I would say 
I find the love I have be look for 
it be a real love it be a real love 
it be a real love it be a real love 
Said come on baby we really get something 
it be a soul connection you be changin my world 
give I you affection be my girl 
it be a real love it be a real love 
it be a real love it be a real love 
the thing about you so far you squeeze my peach 
then you send I postcard of girl on beach 
you be drink in a bar in Amsterdam 
I be think baby far out be my man 
it be a real love it be a real love 
it be a real love it be a real love 
I find the love I have be look for 
it be a real love it be a real love 
stand up behind a electric guitar 
it be a real love it be a real love 
and all the time I be think no way 
and all the time I never think I would say 
I find the love I have be look for 
it be a real love it be a real love
