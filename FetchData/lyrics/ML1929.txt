[Verse 1]
Death until the dust, and we're waiting
Ruined in the rust, of our craving
It feels like, it feels like
Don't you know the cost, of your betrayal?
You're the one that's lost, you're gonna fail
It feels like, it feels like you're gasping with all your might
[Chorus]
You can't take away my strength
Fix these broken veins
There's nothing left to fight (Live free or let me die)
You can't take away my pride, I won't be denied
There's nothing left to fight (Live free or let me die)
[Verse 2]
Insects walk below, I'm on a wire
Fire will burn below, but I am higher
It feels like, it feels like
Don't you know the cost, of your betrayal?
You're the one that's lost, you're gonna fail
It feels like, it feels like you're gasping with all your might
[Chorus]
You can't take away my strength
Fix these broken veins
There's nothing left to fight (Live free or let me die)
You can't take away my pride, I won't be denied
There's nothing left to fight (Live free or let me die)
[Bridge]
Do you remember how
You became who you are now?
Do you remember how
It felt to breathe without
Gasping with all your might?
[Chorus]
You can't take away my strength
Fix these broken veins
Nothing left to fight
[Chorus]
You can't take away my strength
Fix these broken veins
There's nothing left to fight (Live free or let me die)
You can't take away my pride, I won't be denied
There's nothing left to fight (Live free or let me die)
[Outro]
Nothing left to fight (Nothing left to fight)
Live free or let me die
Nothing left to fight (Nothing left to fight)
Live free or let me die
Nothing left to fight (Nothing left to fight)
Live free or let me die
