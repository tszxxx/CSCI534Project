I be the king of burn daylight holdin my own 
I have be doin alright leave well enough alone 
my Daddy tell I I be lazy my momma say I love you too 
I kind of like just doin nothing 
it be something that I do 
I kind of like just doin nothing 
it be something that I do 
I read the sport page make some coffee turn the tv on 
I feed the gold fish fix a sandwich ignore the telephone 
my baby tell I you be so lazy my baby say we love you too 
I kind of like just doin nothing 
it be something that I do 
it be something that I do 
I get a cabin and a campfire star up in the sky 
I get a ummm good hearted woman I think I be get by 
I tell my baby I be the barritz my baby say you move I too 
I kind of like just doin nothing 
it be something that I do 
it be something that I do 
alright 
I love a clear day a open highway a lonesome fiddle tune 
I love a party with friend and family nap in the afternoon 
I might be lazy I be not crazy I love my baby she love I too 
I kind of like just doin nothing 
it be something that I do 
I kind of like just doin nothing 
it be something that I do 
it be something that I do 
it be something that I do 
alright
