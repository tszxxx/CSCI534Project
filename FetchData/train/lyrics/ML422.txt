You keep callin' me
On the telephone
You say you're all alone
Well that's real sad
And you keep leavin'
Notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more
Girl that's too bad
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
Once there was this
Spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web
Of love and lies
She spun her chains
Around my heart and soul
Never to let go
Oh, but I survived
(Chorus)
There's nothin' left you can do
To try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do
Just brings me down, whoa
(Chorus x4)
