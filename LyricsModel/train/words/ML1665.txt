a photograph a blanket 
some mistletoe confetti snow 
a angel to put on a tree 
Santa Claus in crayon 
to make you smile today 
while you be so far away 
so I be send you a little Christmas 
wrap up with love 
a little peace a little light 
to remind you of 
how I be wait for you pray for you 
I want you to see 
so I be send you a little Christmas 
till you come home to I 
some gingerbread a candy cane 
a stocking I make with you name 
I fill it with you favorite thing 
a way to say I love you 
like kiss through the air 
hope you will feel I there 
so I be send you a little Christmas 
wrap up with love 
a little peace a little light 
to remind you of 
how I be wait for you pray for you 
I want you to see 
so I be send you a little Christmas 
till you come home to I 
Home into these arm of mine 
home where you belong 
so I be send you a little Christmas 
wrap up with love 
a little peace a little light 
to remind you of 
how I be wait for you pray for you 
I want you to see 
so I be send you a little Christmas 
till you come home 
Home till you come home to I
