[verse 1]
There's a war going down between
My brothers tonight
I don't want no war
Going down tonight
[Chorus]
Stop this war
Stop this war
[verse 2]
Civilization: Ha
!
I call it as I see it
I call it bullshit you know
I still cannot believe it
Our evolution now
Has gone the way of hate
A world evolved resolved
Into this stupid fate
[Chorus]
[verse 3]
All so different - Yeah
I say were all the same
All caught you know in the division game
Self destruction fast
Impending like a bullet
No one can stop it
Once it's fired no one can control it
[Chorus]
[verse 4]
A final word:
Wait, it's not a call to action
We ain't no sect
No this ain't no fucking faction
Unity unity unity
You've heard it all before
This time it's not exclusive
We want to stop a war
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Ain't nothing wrong
With another unity song
Ain't nothing wrong
With another unity song
Ain't nothing wrong
[Chorus]
[coda]
Unity as one, stand together
Unity 
evolution's gonna come
