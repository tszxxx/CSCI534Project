I have travel around this country cross the water deep and wide 
make lot of friend and memory bring joy to other 's life

and I can not keep from wonderin how the old folk be at home

trim the tree and wrap the present turn the Christmas music on 
this Christmas I will be home with bell on 
when the snow be on the meadow and the sleigh bell jingle bright 
and the kid be sing jingle bell around the Christmas light 
as daddy stoke the fire and mama put the turkey on 
there be not nothing go to slow I down this Christmas I will be home
