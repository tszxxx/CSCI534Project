somewhere over the rainbow Way up high there 's a land that I hear of once in a lullaby somewhere over the rainbow Skies be blue and the dream that you dare to dream really do come true Someday I will wish upon a star and wake up where the cloud be far behind I where trouble melt like lemon drop away above the chimney top that 's where you will find I somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly bird fly over the rainbow why then , oh why can not I ? if happy little bluebird fly Beyond the rainbow why , oh why can not I ?
