you search I you know I 
you see my every move 
there be nothing I could ever do 
to hide myself from you 
you know my thought my fear and hurt 
my weakness and pride 
you know what I be go through 
and how I feel inside 
but even though you know 
you will always love I 
even though you know 
you will never let I go 
I do not deserve you love 
but you give it freely 
you will always love I 
even though you know 
yes you will always love I 
even though you know
