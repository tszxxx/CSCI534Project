Ever feel like dying
Ever feel alone
Ever feel like crying
Lost child in a store
Ever feel life pushing shoving you away
Ever feel like breaking down funeral in the rain
Feel like slipping away
[Hook]
Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain - better believe it
Ever feel like lying
Down inside a grave
Listen to the eulogy
A buyer of the hate
Ever dance beside the devil
Taste the barrel of a gauge
Ever pull the trigger
The light begins to fade
Feel like slipping away
[Hook]
Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain — better believe it
[Bridge]
I've asked you for forgiveness
I've asked you for your grace
I've asked you for your blessing
I've asked that I be saved
Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage — better believe it
[Hook]
Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage — better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain — better believe it
Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage — better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain — better believe it
