Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple of tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
Everyone *dancing* merrily in the new old-fashioned way
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree *at the chistmas party hop*
*Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple of tries to stop*
Rocking around the christmas tree have a happy holiday
Everyones dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned
Rocking around the chrismas tree have a happy holiday
Everyones dancing merrily in the new old-fashion way
