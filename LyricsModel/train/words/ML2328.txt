the darkness bleed its violent sigh and purge from within death , it hold you in its arm and kiss you goodnight oh , oh , oh the darkness come oh , oh , oh i feel its bite it purge from within it 's over , it 's over this haunt be over they cut my wrist and watch I bleed inside a dream and over , and over this haunt be over they cut my wrist and watch I bleed they stop haunt I Darkness bleed its violent sigh and purge from within death it hold you in its arm and kiss you goodnight
