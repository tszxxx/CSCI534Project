may you soul be bless 
may you body rest 
on the mountain where you be bear 
may you spirit soar 
where there be joy ever more 
may you find you way in peace 
and there be no more harm 
in you savior 's arm 
see you fly away in the sky 
do you hear the call of angel one and all 
may you find you way peace 
may you know you be love 
may you shine above on the mountain where you be bear 
may you spirit soar 
there be no pain anymore 
may you find you way in peace 
and there be no more harm 
in you savior 's arm 
see you fly away in the sky 
do you hear the call of angel one and all 
may you find you way in peace 
may you find you way in peace 
may you find you way in peace
