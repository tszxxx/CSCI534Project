Those tire tracks
Zigzag your torso like a Devil's self portrait
The car accident, the skin graft treatment
The flower baskets, the wincing relatives
You bid her farewell then got in your car
And that's the last thing that you can recall
And when they pulled you out
You didn't know your name
Exploding semi truck blurred your face with flame
You met Jane four years ago today
Dancing at some vomit-stained frat party
Her newspaper gown, glowing headline brown
Her violent gypsy dance, her tired underpants
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rhymes with pity now
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rhymes with sympathy now
Jane let you touch and feel her
She was so free like a pineapple in a tree
You said it's dangerous
To be so intimate
You know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous
Jane said when she laid on her back
The sun hit her body like an ugly landscape
But some things never get better
Like used cars and bad livers
So you traded her in for a better looking brand
One with fake porno tits
A padlock on her lips
Disposable tan, biodegradable hands
Back at the hospital
You got no visitors at all
She visits you in your sleep
But that newspaper gown is always on fire [x2]
She met him a week after you left her
When you tossed out her touch to the garbage collector
He talked her out of her skirt in his beer-soaked apartment
And then they did all the things
You never said that you wanted
And the sirens are laughing underneath your skull
And your thoughts are turning dull, callous and cold
Yesterday you gave your burden a name
Yesterday you gave your burden a face
But your burden looks an awful lot like her
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rhymes with pity now
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rhymes with sympathy now
