[Verse 1]
It ain't the way you move
It ain't the way that you move me
Oh no
It ain't the way you shake
It ain't the way that you shake me
Oh no
I've lived 25 years as a kid on the run
I've got a pistol for action
[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
[Verse 2]
I love the way you use
I love the way that you use me
Oh yeah
I love the way you shoot
I love the way that you shoot to kill me
Oh yeah
It's taken miles and lines to learn the right from the wrong
I'll keep you hanging on
[Chorus]
So don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
(love me, you love me)
Don't tell me you love me
(you love me, you love me)
Don't tell me you love me
(you love me, you love me)
Don't tell me you love me
Love me, love me, yeah
[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
