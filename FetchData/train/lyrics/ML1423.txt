Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Glory
Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
Ohh, yes Lord
Sometimes I'm almost To the ground
Oh yes, Lord
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Anybody knows the trouble I've seen Glory
Hallelujah
If you got there before I do
Oh yes Lord Tell all my friends
I'm Coming too, oh yes Lord
Nobody knows the trouble
I've seen Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Glory
Hallelujah
Although you see me Goin' on so
Oh yes I have my trials
Here below Ohh yes, Lord
Oh, nobody knows the trouble I've seen Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Glory
Hallelujah Ohh, glory, Hallelujah
