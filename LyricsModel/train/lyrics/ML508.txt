[Verse 1]
Hello my friend
I remember when you were
So alive with your wide eyes 'til the light
That you had when your heart was stolen
Now you say that it ain't worth stayin'
You wanna run but you're hesitatin
'
I'm talkin' to me
[Chorus]
Don't let the lights go down
Don't let the fire burn out
Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now?
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found
[Verse 2]
So when you get the chance (when you get the chance)
Are you gonna take it?
There's a really big world at your fingertips
And you know you have the chance to change it
There's a girl on the streets, she's cryin'
There's a man whose faith is dyin'
Love is calling you (it's calling you)
[Chorus]
Don't let the lights go down
Don't let the fire burn out
Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now?
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found
[Bridge]
Why do we go with the flow?
Why take the easier road?
Why are we playin' it safe? (don't play it safe)
Love came to show us the way
Love is a chance we should take
I'm movin' out of the gray
Dada dada da da
Dada dada da da
[Chorus]
Don't let the lights go down
Don't let the fire burn out
Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Stand out
Don't let the lights go down
Don't let the fire burn out (stand out)
Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now?
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found
[Outro]
So when you get the chance
Are you gonna take it?
There's a really big world at your fingertips
And you know you have the chance to change it
