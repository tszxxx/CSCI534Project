[Verse 1]
I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to
Somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time
[Chorus]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
[Verse 2]
We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh, what's a heart to do?
Because it lingers
And the thought of you
Wanting me as much as I want you
[Chorus]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
[Verse 3]
Makes me blue
I'm not holding you
Tonight
Because only you
Can satisfy
This heart of mine
[Chorus]
So when you think about love, think about me
'Cause I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
So when you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
'Cause I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
'Cause I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
