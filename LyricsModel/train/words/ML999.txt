I have be down and I be wonder why 
these little black cloud keep walk around 
with I 
with I 
it waste time and I would rather be high 
think I will walk I outside and buy a rainbow smile 
but be free 
they be all free 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
I look around at a beautiful life 
I have be the upperside of down be the inside of out 
but we breathe 
we breathe 
I want to breeze and a open mind 
I want to swim in the ocean want to take my time 
for I 
all I 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home 
so maybe tomorrow 
I will find my way home
