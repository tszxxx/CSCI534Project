if you disrespect anybody 
that you run in to 
how in the world do you think 
anybody be suppose to respect you 
if you do not give a heck bout the man 
with the Bible in he hand 
just get out the way 
and let the gentleman do he thing 
you be the kind of gentleman 
that want everything you way 
take the sheet off you face boy 
it be a brand new day 
respect yourself respect yourself 
if you do not respect yourself 
be not nobody go to give a good cahoot to to to to 
respect yourself respect yourself 
if you be walk round 
thinkin that the world 
owe you something 
cause you be here 
you be goin out 
the world backwards 
like you do 
when you first come here 
keep talkin bout the president 
will not stop air pollution 
put you hand on you mouth 
when you cough that will help the solution 
oh you cuss around woman folk 
and you do not even know they name 
and you be dumb enough to think 
that will make you a big ol man 
respect yourself respect yourself 
if you do not respect yourself 
be not nobody go to give a good cahoot to to to to 
respect yourself respect yourself 
respect yourself respect yourself
