[Verse 1]
I don't know how I survived
In this cold and empty world for all this time
I only know that I'm alive
Because you love me
[Verse 2]
When I recall what I've been through
There's some things that I wish I didn't do
Now I do the things I do
Because you love me
[Chorus]
And now that you're in my life, I'm so glad I'm alive
'Cause you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you love me
[Chorus]
Oh, and now that you're in my life
Oh, I'm so glad I'm alive
'Cause you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you love me
[Verse 3]
I believe in things unseen
I believe in the message of a dream
And I believe in what you are
Because you love me
[Verse 4]
With all my heart and all my soul
I'm loving you and I never will let go
And every day I'll let it show
Because you love me
[Outro]
Because you love me
Ooh, because you love me
