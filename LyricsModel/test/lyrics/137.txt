Within Attraction
Once I was there standing outside looking in
Beside my window smiling face, shattering
It's an old man's pride that climbs over understanding
It wasn't your child that I was hurting
And I turn my back to the world, well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
And I turn my back to the world, well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
Under the dying sun it comes weaving fear but I have none
I know that mushroom cloud won't come very near
What do you have to believe in and all the poison you breathe in
The crystal heart shatters within
Once I was there standing outside moving in
Inside my window crying face, shattering
Take all that you have and leave the rest now for today
It's the old folks' sign that took away your chastity
And I turn my back to the world, well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
And I turn my back to the world, well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
Under the dying sun it comes weaving fear but I have none
I know that mushroom cloud won't come very near
What do you have to believe in and all the poison you breathe in
The crystal heart shatters within
Shatters within
Shatters within
Shatters within
Shatters within
