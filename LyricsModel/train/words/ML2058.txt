you be talk to she 
but mess with I 
it be finally clear 
you be blur the line 
be you disturbed 
oh now you care 
why do you race through my red light 
can not understand 
I will slow it down for you 
tell I how can you sleep 
how can you breathe 
baby tell I how 
how you love I now 
tell I how can you sleep 
how can you breathe 
I hate when you say 
how you love I now 
save 
save it for she 
I be not go to hear 
you reason and please just take I back 
we never be right 
do not waste you breath 
you crash and you be on you own tonight 
can not understand 
I will slow it down for you 
tell I how can you sleep 
how can you breathe 
baby tell I how 
how you love I now 
tell I how can you sleep 
how can you breathe 
I hate when you say 
how you love I now 
light out 
I find out 
my falling star 
Goodbye 
the sun rise here 
there be no more you and I 
tell I how can you sleep 
how can you breathe 
baby tell I how 
how you love I now 
tell I how can you sleep 
how can you breathe 
I hate when you say 
how you love I now 
how you love I now 
how you love I now
