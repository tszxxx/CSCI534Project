a woman in love 
a woman in love 
a woman in love 
a woman in love 
speak 
have you ever see a woman in love 
she walk taller than the highest mountain in the sky above 
she glow like the beautiful ray of the sun 
have you ever see a woman in love 
have you see a woman in love 
she know how to make sunshine out of the rain 
a woman in love 
know exactly how to kiss away the pain 
sing chorus 
a woman in love be more precious than gold 
a woman in love be the truth untold 
a woman in love seem to carry 
the whole world in she arm 
a woman in love 
a woman in love 
a woman in love 
a woman in love 
speak 
have you ever see a woman in love 
she carry a special purpose in this world 
she glow like the beautiful ray of the sun 
have you ever see a woman in love 
Chorus
