Like nobody else can doThrill me, baby, thrill meLike nobody else can doEvery time you touch meIt feels like a cold from out of the blueYou've got ways that is sweetAnd your lips taste just like honey dewYou've got ways that is sweetAnd your lips taste just like honey dewYou belong to me, daddyAnd you really know just what to doI'm telling youFrom your head down to your toesYou're sharp, goodness knowsWhen you walk down the streetAll the chicks' hearts skip a beatI don't blame them, baby'Cause you really know just what to doEvery time you touch meIt feels like a cold from out of the blue
