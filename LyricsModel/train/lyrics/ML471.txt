[Verse 1: John Gourley]
Save me, I can't be saved
I won't
I'm a president's son
I don't need no soul
[Chorus: John Gourley]
All the soldiers say, "It'll be alright
We may make it through the war
If we make it through the night"
All the people, they say
"What a lovely day, yeah, we won the war
May have lost a million men
But we've got a million more"
All the people, they say
[Verse 2: John Gourley]
Share with me all of your pain
I won't
Share your love
I need all your love
[Chorus: Portugal. The Man]
All the soldiers say "It'll be alright
We may make it through the war
If we make it through the night"
All the people, they see
"What a lovely day, yeah, we won the war
May have lost a million men
But we've got a million more"
All the people, they say
[Verse 3: John Gourley]
Can't save me
I can't be saved
I won't
I don't need no love
I'm a president's son
[Chorus: Portugal. The Man]
All the soldiers say "It'll be alright
We may make it through the war
If we make it through the night"
All the people, they say
"What a lovely day, yeah, we won the war
May have lost a million men
But we've got a million more"
All the people, they see
All the people, they see
[Outro: Portugal. The Man &amp;
