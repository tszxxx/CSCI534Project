[Verse]
See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me
[Chorus]
Ooh..
Falling in and out of love
In love, in love
Ooh...
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love
[Verse]
See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me
[Chorus 1]
Ooh...
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love
Ooh...
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love
In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love
[Chorus 2]
Ooh...
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love
Ooh...
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love
[Post-Chorus]
Why can’t you see it
Why can’t you feel
In and out of love each time
Why can’t you feel it
Why can’t you see it
In and out of love
I keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Don’t let it fade away
You keep keep running
I keep keep falling
[Outro]
Ooh...
Away, away, away
Away, don’t let it fade away
