For God I`m a slave To get to heaven Reverend said I gotta be saved
And behave And also stuck in my ways Give Him praise
Words can`t express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death
 (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I`m seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don`t wanna do no more dirt
 (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It`s time to come home
[Verse 2: Beyoncé

It doesn`t matter where you been Or what you did wrong
It doesn`t matter who you are  You`re always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes And you confess
If you committed any sin you`ll be forgiven
[Hook: Beyoncé, Angie Stone &amp; Melba Moore]
Callin on all of God`s children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I`ve been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)
[Interlude]
Come on home
Come on come on home
Oooh yeah yeah

If you can`t see your way out And you`re drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want
 But you still can`t find happiness
It`s when you feel like you`re forsaken Life can be
 so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home So your life can be cleansed
[Hook: Beyoncé, Angie Stone &amp; Melba Moore]
Callin on all of God`s children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I`ve been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)
[Bridge: Beyoncé, Angie Stone &amp; Melba Moore]
Don`t bare the burden all by yourself (By yourself)
The Redeemer`s here He`s gonna give you help (Give you help)
Come unto Him and He will give you rest
For any heart that`s heavy laden
Soul salvation, ooh
[Hook: Beyoncé, Angie Stone &amp; Melba Moore]
Callin on all of God`s children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I`ve been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)
