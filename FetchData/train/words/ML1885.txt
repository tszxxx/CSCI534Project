habit alone , when separate I moan Feeding on bone or anything grow I command post and nobody show in morning I rest here in evening I work here my debt be not spend till the rest of I 's leave all I adore ... you must be the call the evil at night speak word of grace while spellwork delight feel my desire , it burn like a fire feel my desire , it burn like a fire I work alone save my soul if yesterday hurt , tomorrow be worse send I a sign , for my body 's align I be ready to waste all my limb and my face my pore be wide open and bleed for you potion Spellwork and lie ! you must be the call the evil at night speak word of grace while spellwork delight feel my desire , it burn like a fire feel my desire , it burn like a fire you must be the call the evil at night speak word of grace while spellwork delight feel my desire , it burn like a fire feel my desire , it burn like a fire
