the open wound I cut now fester and succumb 
to insect infestation bacterial infiltration 
on a micro biotic level they grow and overtake 
a human piece of waste a experiment of decay 
God of the fly release you seed of filth 
to grow and conquer on death on myself 
maggot maggot on my corpse 
feeding seep pus do flow 
rotten body 
the maggot feed and grow the maggot feed and grow
