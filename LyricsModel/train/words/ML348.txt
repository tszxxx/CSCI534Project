here come the sun doo dun doo doo 
here come the sun and I say 
it be all right 
little darling it be be a long cold lonely winter 
little darling it feel like year since it be be here 
here come the sun doo dun doo doo 
here come the sun and I say 
it be all right 
little darling the smile 's return to they face 
little darling it seem like year since it be be here 
here come the sun 
here come the sun and I say 
it be all right 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
little darling I feel that ice be slowly melt 
little darling it seem like year since it be be clear 
here come the sun doo dun doo doo 
here come the sun and I say 
it be all right 
here come the sun doo dun doo doo 
here come the sun 
it be all right 
it be all right
