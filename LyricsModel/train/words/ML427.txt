I be just tryin to stay out of you danged ol way 
to heck with this to heck with we 
and shoot if I will ever look back on where I have be 
shoot if I will ever give away my heart again 
love you love this town 
love this mother lovin truck 
that keep breakin lovin down 
there be only one four letter word that will do 
love you 
love you cat love this house 
well I can not believe myself that I be lovin gettin out 
love talkin' love fightin 
the thought of never seein you lovin face 
there be some word that some word just have to replace 
love you love this town

of all you lovin around 
there be only one four letter word that will do 
love you 
love you love this town 
and I be sick on lovin tired 
of all you lovin around

love you love this town

that keep breakin lovin down 
there be only one four letter word that will do 
love you
