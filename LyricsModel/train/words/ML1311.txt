I have be a lot of place 
my foot have kiss this land 
I try real hard to remember all the face 
none seem to have what yours demand 
I take a train to Chicago 
think I could clear my mind 
I take a plane out to find some truth 
but all I find I can not seem to leave behind 
I dream of Chicago 
I dream of we youth 
I dream I could go and say all the thing 
that I never say to you 
I be sure I use to love you 
and I be sure you make I such a fool 
but you be silent with you heart and affection 
tell I girl what be a boy suppose to do 
I dream of Chicago 
I dream of we youth 
I dream I could go and say all the thing 
that I never say to you 
I dream of Chicago 
I dream of we youth 
I dream I could go and say all the thing 
that I never say to you 
I dream of Chicago 
I dream of we youth 
I dream I could go and say all the thing 
that I never say to you 
I dream of Chicago 
I dream of we youth 
I dream I could go and say all the thing 
that I never say to you 
that I never say to you
