excuse I miss can I have 
just one dance with you 
must admit I be hook 
the moment I see you 
candle light atmosphere 
music in the air

I be lovin the clothes you wear 
double dare you to take 
take a chance tonight 
do not resist I can feel 
that the time be right

do you come with you girl 
or be you by yourself 
if you would like to be friend
