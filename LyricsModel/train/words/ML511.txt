I have find he grace be all complete 
he supply my every need 
while I sit and learn at Jesus 's foot 
I be free indeed 
what kind of joy be this 
it be joy unspeakable all you have do for I 
it be indescribable just a taste of you glory 
it be unnatural not to tell the story of all you have give I 
my word be incomplete it be joy unspeakable 
I have find the pleasure I once crave 
it be joy and peace within within 
what a wondrous blessing I be save 
from the awful gulf of sin 
it be joy unspeakable all you have do for I 
it be indescribable just a taste of you glory 
it be unnatural not to tell the story of all you have give I 
my word be incomplete 
I have find the joy no tongue can tell 
how it be wafe of glory roll 
it be like a overflow well 
spring up within my soul 
it be unspeakable all you have do for I 
it be indescribable just a taste of you glory 
it be unnatural not to tell the story of all you have give I 
my word be incomplete 
it be joy unspeakable 
Joy unspeakable 
what kind of joy be this
