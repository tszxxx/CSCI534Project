I feel the sun , it ?s return again to chase the cold far away I ?m not alone to fight the world I ? m in you give I hope for better day I be search for a friend like no other I never think you ? d come my way everything I give to you I ? will love you so everything I say or do I ? will love you so look where we ? have come , how could I ever forget before you love my heart be dead ? I be afraid that my sun would set but you stay around to lift my head I be live my whole life undercover I never dream I?d see you face everything I give to you I ? will love you so and everything I say or do I ? will love you so ooh , I ? will love you so ooh , I ? will love you so everything I give to you I ? will let it go everything I say or do I ? will love you so ooh , I ? will love you so ooh , I ? will love you so I ? will love you so I feel the sun
