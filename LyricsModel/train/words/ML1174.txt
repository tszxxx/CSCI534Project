we day will come 
and we will have everything 
we will share the joy 
fall in love can bring 
no one can tell I 
that I be too young to know 
I love you so 
and you love I 
we day will come 
if we just wait a while 
no tear for we 
think love and wear a smile 
we dream have magic because 
we will always stay 
in love this way 
we day will come 
we dream have magic because 
W will always stay 
in love this way 
we day will come 
we day will come
