listen to the music 
the sound of the angel 
come and see the child 
who can make you whole 
lie in a manger 
away from harm and danger

sweet beautiful soul save joy 
oh joy joy joy in my soul 
Joy joy joy in my soul oh

this special gift of love 
more precious than silver or gold 
he be send this holiday 
to take we pain away 
go tell it on the mountain 
shout it from a valley 
tell about the baby in swaddling clothes 
man in every nation

Way down deep joy

I have get joy 
Way down deep inside my soul joy 
unspeakable joy 
Joy in my soul
