be not it strange 
how everybody say I love you 
be not it a shame 
how a word can not tell you more than word can say 
I need you here 
be not it strange 
cause I be always thinkin of ya 
be not it a shame 
how a thought can catch the breeze and blow away 
I need you here 
oh but I know how bad it can get 
but I do not mind 
baby I do not mind 
but I know how soon you will forget I 
but time keep blare 
baby time take care of I 
be not it strange 
how a man who live for nothing can change 
cause if he stay the same he will die a million day 
year by year 
there be a drain 
at the bottom of the ocean 
and when it rain 
we will get close to where the water meet the sky 
for you and I 
oh but I do not know how far this could go 
but I do not mind 
baby I do not mind 
there be no use in sayin 
that you have be sprayin 
but even stranger know how strange it can be 
we be only get old 
cause that be what we be tell to do 
but they sang to get through 
but what be that get to do with we 
so go on and work it out
