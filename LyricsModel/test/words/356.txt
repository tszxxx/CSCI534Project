why can not I lay low ? why can not I say what I mean ? why do not I stay home and get myself into some boring routine ? why can not I calm down ? why be it always a fight ? I can not get unwound why do I throw myself into the night ? I be on the outside I do not fit into a groove now , I be not a bad guy so tell I what be I try to prove ? why can not I cool out ? why do not I button my lip ? why do I lash out ? why be it I always shoot from the hip ? I cruise from Houston to Canal Street , a misfit and a rebel I see the wino talk to themselves and I can understand why be it everytime I go out I always seem to get in trouble ? I guess I make a impression on somebody north of Hester and South of Grand and so in my small way I be a big man on Mulberry Street I do not mean always only at night when I be light on my foot what else have I get that I would be try to hide ? maybe a blind spot I have not see from the sensitive side ? but you know in my own heart I be a big man on Mulberry Street I have play the whole part I will leave a big tip with every receipt I be so romantic I be such a passionate man sometimes I panic what if nobody find out who I be ?
