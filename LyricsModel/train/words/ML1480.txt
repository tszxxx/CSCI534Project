sometimes you love I 
like a good man oughta 
sometimes you hurt I so bad 
my tear run like water 
ya get I out 
not before you friend 
when ya disown I baby 
until we alone again 
you love be like a see see 
you love be like a see see baby 
you love be like a see see 
go up 
down 
all around 
like a see see 
sometimes you tell I 
you be goin be my sweet candy man 
and then sometimes baby 
never know where I stand 
ya lift I up 
when be on the ground 
but as soon as I get up babe 
you send I tumblin down 
now you love be like a see see 
you love be like a see see baby 
you love be like a see see 
go up 
down 
all around 
just like a see see 
when I kiss ya and I like it 
and I ask you to kiss I again 
when I reach for you you jump clean out of site 
ya change just like the wind 
that be not right 
that be not right 
that be not right 
you love be like a see see 
you love be like a see see baby 
you love be like a see see 
go up 
down 
all around 
just like a see see
