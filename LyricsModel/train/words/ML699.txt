I be in love with the girl that I be talk about 
I be in love with the girl I can not live without 
I be in love but I sure pick a bad time 
to be in love 
to be in love

I do not want to know about it 
there be too many other that know what I mean 
and that be why I get to live without it 
I be in love with the girl I be talk about 
I be in love with the girl I can not live without 
I be in love but I feel like I be wearin it out 
I be in love but I must have pick a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love

from my friend and the people I do not want to see 
the thing they say I know just could not be true 
at least not until I hear it from you 
cause I still love the little girl I be talk about 
I be in love with the girl I can not live without 
I be in love but I feel like I be wearin it out 
I be in love but I must have pick a bad time to be in love
