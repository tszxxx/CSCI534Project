for you there will be no more crying 
for you the sun will be shine 
and I feel that when I be with you 
it be alright I know it be right 
to you I will give the world 
to you I will never be cold 
cause I feel that when I be with you 
it be alright I know it be right 
and the songbird be sing 
like they know the score 
and I love you I love you I love you 
like never before 
and I wish you all the love in the world 
but most of all I wish it from myself 
and the songbird keep singing 
like they know the score 
and I love you I love you I love you 
like never before 
like never before 
like never before
