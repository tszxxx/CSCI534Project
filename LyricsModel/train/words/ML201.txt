do you hear I I be talk to you 
across the water across the deep blue ocean 
under the open sky oh my baby I be try 
Boy I hear you in my dream 
I feel you whisper across the sea 
I keep you with I in my heart 
you make it easier when life get hard 
lucky I be in love with my best friend 
lucky to have be where I have be 
lucky to be come home again 
ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
they do not know how long it take 
wait for a love like this 
every time we say goodbye 
I wish we have one more kiss 
I will wait for you I promise you I will 

Chorus 
Jason Mraz &amp Colbie Caillat 
lucky I be in love with my best friend 
lucky to have be where I have be 
lucky to be come home again 
lucky we be in love in every way 
lucky to have stay where we have stay 
lucky to be come home someday 
and so I be sailing through the sea 
to a island where we will meet 
you will hear the music fill the air 
I will put a flower in you hair 
though the breeze through the tree 
move so pretty you be all I see 
as the world keep spin round 
you hold I right here right now 
lucky I be in love with my best friend 
lucky to have be where I have be 
lucky to be come home again 
lucky we be in love in every way 
lucky to have stay where we have stay 
lucky to be come home someday 
ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
