you must think I very naive 
take as true 
I only see what I want to see 
avoid eye contact at all cost 
what can I do 
to see you fine tooth smile at I 
I be not say 
that we should build a city of tear 
all I be say 
be I be alone and consequently 
only my dream satisfy the real need of my heart 
I resist 
you say that there be a thousand like you 
well maybe that be true 
I fall for you and nobody else 
so I be stand here so lonesome 
what can I do 
but learn to laugh at myself 
I be not say 
that we should build a city of tear 
all I be say 
be I be alone and consequently 
only my dream satisfy the real need of my heart 
I resist 
I be not say 
that we should build a city of tear 
all I be say 
be I be alone 
fall fall fall again 
cause I want to take the pleasure with the pain 
fall falling falling and laugh 
cause I want to take 
the pleasure with the pain 
fall falling 
fall and laugh 
fall and laugh 
fall and laugh
