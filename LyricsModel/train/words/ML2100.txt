free as a bird 
it be the next best thing to be 
free as a bird 
home home and dry 
like a homing bird I will fly 
as a bird on wing 
whatever happen to 
the life that we once know 
can we really live without each other 
where do we lose the touch 
that seem to mean so much 
it always make I feel so 
free as a bird 
it be the next best thing to be 
free as a bird 
home home and dry 
like a homing bird I will fly 
as a bird on wing 
whatever happen to 
the life that we once know 
always make I feel so free 
ah 
ah 
ah 
free as a bird 
it be the next best thing to be 
free as a bird 
free as a bird 
free as a bird 
oooooo 
free 
make for John Lennon
