If I stop – and think about it
I'm either stone cold certain
Or more inclined to doubt it
But when you jump into the darkness
Well I take off my hat
You've changed
They say –
You can know when to play or to hold
And they think they can show all that glitters is gold
And they don't care to go where you go 'cause they know you're insane
When you change
To the Uptown Train
Well I knew – that you were trouble
You were a ten time loser
Or maybe even double
But you pulled some kind of rabbit
From your hippie hat
You've changed
They say –
Take it slow when you're breaking the mold
Got to pay what you owe or be out in the cold
And they don't care to know what you know or to go through the pain
To change
To the Uptown Train
