Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the mornin' last
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun and feelin' groovy (Feelin' groovy, feelin' groovy)
Ba-da-da, da-da, da-da
Feelin' groovy
Ba-da-da, da-da, da-da
Feelin' groovy
Hello, lamppost, whatcha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't you got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in, doo-doo, feelin' groovy (Feelin' groovy, feelin' groovy)
Ba-da-da, da-da, da-da
Feelin' groovy
Ba-da-da, da-da, da-da
Feelin' groovy
I got no deeds to do, nor promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy
Daa daa daa
Daa daa daa
Daa daa daa
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the mornin' last
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun and feelin' groovy (Feelin' groovy, feelin' groovy)
Ba-da-da, da-da, da-da
Feelin' groovy
Daa daa daa
Daa daa daa
Daa daa daa
