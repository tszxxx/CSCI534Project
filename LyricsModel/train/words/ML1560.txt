some people wake up on Monday morning 
bar maelstrom and red flag warning 
with no explosion and no surprise 
perform a series of exercise 
hold you fire 
take you place around a open fire 
before you neuron declare a crisis 
before you trace Serotonin rise 
before you be read you coffee grounds 
and before a pundit could make a sound 
and before you be read you list of vice 
perform the simplest exercise 
so here we be at the end the war be over 
there be nothing leave to defend no cliff of dover 
so let we put down we pen and this conclude the test 
we mind be scatter about from hell to breakfast
