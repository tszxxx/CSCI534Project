Wanna thank you, Wanna thank you
Freedom in stride, love, peace of mind
We just wanna give Gratitude
Got plenty love we wanna give to you
With good music and we're tryin' to say
That the Good Lord's gonna make a way
Open up your heart, let your body find
Freedom in your stride, love, peace of mind
One more time and we got to say
That the Good Lord gonna make a way
