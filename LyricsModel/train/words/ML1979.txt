but you let go 
because you hope be go 
and every question fade away 
it be a shame you do not know what you be run from 
would you bone have to break and you light turn off 
will it take the end of time to hear you heart 's false start 
you know this be you biggest mistake 
what a waste what a waste what a waste 
and of all the thing you never explain 
you know this be you biggest mistake 
you tread water 
fight for the air in you lung 
move move closer 
maybe you can right all you wrong 
but you let go 
because you hope be go 
and every answer fade away 
it be a shame you do not know what you be run from 
would you bone have to break and you light turn off 
will it take the end of time to hear you heart 's false start 
you know this be you biggest mistake 
what a waste what a waste what a waste 
and of all the thing you never explain 
you know this be you biggest mistake 
wipe the mud spray from you face 
stop the engine and stop pretend 
wipe the mud spray from you face 
stop the engine yeah stop pretend 
that you be still breathe 
it be a shame you do not know what you be run from 
would you bone have to break and you light turn off 
will it take the end of time to hear you heart 's false start 
you know this be you biggest mistake 
what a waste what a waste what a waste 
and of all the thing you never explain 
you know this be you biggest mistake
