hello you say the day we meet 
hand I a yellow rose 
you ask I out and to you surprise 
and to mine I say I would go 
I think it so romantic 
and I find you sweet and bold 
though we would only meet 
I still say yes to a single yellow rose 
and for year to come you be the one 
to sleep with I at night 
to laugh and talk and share my thought 
and hold I when I would cry 
and on every rare occasion 
and for no good reason too 
a big bouquet or a single yellow rose 
be send from you 
yellow rose 
the color of sunshine 
you love I at one time 
why do you have to go 
yellow rose 
be you send you new love 
my bright yellow rose bud 
I still love you so 
I never see a yellow rose 
that I do not think of you 
it be still my favorite flower 
though the yellow turn to blue 
the day you leave my teardrop fall 
upon you farewell note 
you say goodbye like you say hello 
with a single yellow rose 
yellow rose 
the color of sunshine 
you love I at one time 
why do you have to go 
yellow rose 
be you send you new love 
my bright yellow rose bud 
I still love you so 
yellow rose 
the color of sunshine 
you love I at one time 
why do you have to go 
yellow rose 
be you send you new love 
my bright yellow rose bud 
I still love you so
