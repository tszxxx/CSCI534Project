nothing , we be do nothing sit and wonder why nothing 's happen everyone be there in a wooden chair do nothing still do nothing drinking , smoking nothing 's happen no one seem to care in they wooden chair do nothing I go walk through the park Underneath a moldy sky think " yes I think this place would be such a lonely place to die such a lonely place to die nothing we be do nothing literally freeze stiff from nothing happen something have to change cause it 's no longer feeling strange to do nothing ad nauseam nothing and feeling acutely every millisecond pass we can ignore that this be sad because we know that it all add up to nothing I go walk though the park Underneath the moldy sky think about all the different way that would make lonely way to die all the lonely way to die
