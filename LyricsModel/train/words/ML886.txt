oppression be the holy law 
in God I distrust 
in time he monument will fall 
like ashe to dust 
be war and greed the master plan 
the bible 's where it all begin 
it be propaganda sell despair 
and spread the virus everywhere 
religion be hate 
religion be fear 
religion be war 
religion be rape 
religion 's obscene 
religion be a whore 
the pestilence be Jesus Christ 
there never be a sacrifice 
no man upon the crucifix 
beware the cult of purity 
infectious imbecility 
I have make my choice 
six six six 
corruption breed the pedophile 
do not pray for the priest 
confession find the lonely child 
God prey on the weak 
you think you soul can still be save 
I think you be fuck mile away 
scream out loud here be where you begin 
forgive I father for I have sin 
religion be hate 
religion be fear 
religion be war 
religion be rape 
religion 's obscene 
religion be a whore 
the target 's fuck Jesus Christ 
I would have lead the sacrifice 
and nail he to the crucifix 
beware the cult of purity 
infectious imbecility 
I have make my choice 
six six six 
Jesus be pain 
Jesus be gore 
Jesus be the blood 
that be spill in war 
he be everything 
he be all thing dead 
he be pull on the trigger 
point at you head 
through fear you be sell into the fraud 
Revelation revolution 
I see through you Christ illusion 
the war on terror just drag along 
my war with God be grow strong 
he propaganda sell despair 
and spread the violence everywhere 
religion be hate 
religion be fear 
religion be war 
religion be rape 
religion 's obscene 
religion be a whore 
there be no fuckin Jesus Christ 
there never be a sacrifice 
no man upon the crucifix 
beware the cult of purity 
infectious imbecility 
I have make my choice 
six six six
