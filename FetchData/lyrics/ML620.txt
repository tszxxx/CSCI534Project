[Verse 1]
Got to be there, got to be there
In the, in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there
Bring her, bring her good times
And show her that she is my girl
Oh what a feeling there will be
The moment I know she loves me
But when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me
[Verse 2]
So I have got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she is my girl
When she says, "Hello world!"
I need her sharing the world beside me
[Verse 3]
That is why I have got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that is everywhere she goes
I have got to be there so she knows
That when she is with me, she is home, yeah
[Outro]
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, oh baby baby got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, got to be there,  to be there
Got to be there, oh got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there
