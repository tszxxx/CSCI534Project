I be so tired of be here 
suppress by all my childish fear 
and if you have to leave 
I wish that you would just leave 
cause you presence still linger here 
and it will not leave I alone 
these wound will not seem to heal 
this pain be just too real 
there be just too much that time can not erase 
when you cry I would wipe away all of you tear 
when you would scream I would fight away all of you fear 
and I hold you hand through all of these year 
but you still have all of I 
you use to captivate I 
by you resonating light 
now I be bound by the life you leave behind 
you face it haunt 
my once pleasant dream 
you voice it chase away 
all the sanity in I 
these wound will not seem to heal 
this pain be just too real 
there be just too much that time can not erase 
when you cry I would wipe away all of you tear 
when you would scream I would fight away all of you fear 
and I hold you hand through all of these year 
but you still have all of I 
I have try so hard to tell myself that you be go 
but though you be still with I 
I have be alone all along 
when you cry I would wipe away all of you tear 
when you would scream I would fight away all of you fear 
and I hold you hand through all of these year 
but you still have all of I 
ah I ah I ah
