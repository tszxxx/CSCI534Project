there be a reason why I bring 
you this simple offering 
pour out my love to you 
and though my heart can not express 
all this joy and gratefulness 
still I sing this song of love and thanks and praise 
it be because I be forgive 
it be because I be free 
it be because you have show my mercy 
and you believe in I 
it be because you be my savior 
it be because you be my friend 
and you love it lift I higher 
than I have ever be 
oh the wonder of you way 
oh the measure of you grace 
greater than my heart can know 
so how could I not celebrate 
how could I not bless you name 
sing out a song of love and thanks and praise 
it be because I be forgive 
it be because I be free 
it be because you have show my mercy 
and you believe in I 
it be because you be my savior 
it be because you be my friend 
and you love it lift I higher 
than I have ever be 
it be because you be my savior 
it be because you be my friend 
and you love it lift I higher 
than I have ever be 
so much higher 
Higher than I have ever be
