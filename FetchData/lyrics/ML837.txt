If our lips should meet, Innamorata
Kiss me, kiss me sweet Innamorata
Hold me close and say you're mine
With a love as warm as wine
I'm at heaven's door, Innamorata
Want you more and more, Innamorata
You're a symphony, a very beautiful sonata my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love
You're a symphony, a very beautiful sonata my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my one and only sweetheart
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love
