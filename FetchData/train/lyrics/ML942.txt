If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl
If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
Diamond girl you make me feel
Like I'm on fire when you are near
You captivate me with your smile
Girl you make me get so wild
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Diamond girl I'd like to know
If I am getting near your door
Which will only make me want you more
Ooh I feel it coming through your door
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
You fit right on my finger
I'm so proud to have me in you
I persist to enjoy all your gifts
You fit right on my finger
I'm so proud to have me in you
I persist to enjoy all your gifts
Diamond girl where we go wrong
The love I felt was all along
Why did you had to leave so soon
I feel so lonely without love
If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
I'll always be your diamond, girl
You're my diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Daimond girl tú haces sentir
Como estoy en fuego junto a ti
Tú me cautivas con tu amor
Te quiero dar todo mi calor
Mi niña de diamante
Si tu eres, si tu eres
You're my diamond girl
You fit right on my finger
I'm so proud to have me in you
You're my, my diamond girl
