take the ribbon from my hair 
shake it loose and let it fall 
lay it soft upon my skin 
like the shadow on the wall 
come and lay down by my side 
til the early mornin light 
all I be takin be you time 
help I make it through the night 
chorus 
I do not care what be right or wrong 
I will not try to understand 
let the devil take tomorrow 
but tonight I need a friend 
yesterday be dead and go 
and tomorrow be out of sight 
and it be sad to be alone 
help I make it through the night
