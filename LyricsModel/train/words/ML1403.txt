verse 1 Jamie Hince 
Alison Mosshart 

walk you to the counter 
what you get to offer 
pick you out a soda 
look at you forever 
walk you to the water 
eye like a casino 
you be not bear 
typical 
find a piece of silver 
pretty as a diagram 
go down to the Rio 
put it in my left hand 
put it in a fruit machine 
everyone be a winner 
laugh like a seagull 
chorus 
both 

you be a fever you be a fever 
you be not bear typical 
you be a fever you be a fever 
you be not bear typical 
verse 2 Jamie Hince 
Alison Mosshart 
&amp 
both 

live in a suitcase 
meet a clown and fall in love 
be die to have you over 
clown around and break up 
take you to a jukebox 
that be the situation 
pick you out a number 
that be we arrangement 
dance on the leg of a new bear pony 
leave right leave right keep it up so and 
go ahead and have she go ahead and leave she 
you only ever have she when you be a fever 
I be a fever I be a fever 
I be not bear typical 
I be a fever I be a fever 
I be not bear typical 
we be a fever we be a fever 
we be not bear typical 
we be a fever we be a fever 
we be not bear typical 
we be a fever we be a fever 
we be not bear typical 
we be a fever we be a fever 
we be not bear typical
