a V of black swan on with hope to the grave 
and through red September with sky fire pave 
I beg you appear like a thorn for the holy one 
cold be my soul and untold be the pain 
I face when you leave I a rose in the rain 
so I swear to the razor that never enchain 
would you dark nail of faith be push through my vein again 
bare on you tomb I be a prayer for you loneliness 
and would you ever soon come above unto I 
for once upon a time from the bind of you lowliness 
I could always find the right slot for you sacred key 
six foot deep be the incision 
in my heart that barless prison 
discolor all with tunnel vision 
Nymphetamine 
sick and weak from my condition 
this lust this vampiric addiction 
to she alone in full submission 
Nymphetamine 
Nymphetamine nymphetamine 
nymphetamine girl 
Nymphetamine nymphetamine 
my nymphetamine girl 
wrack with you charm I be circle like prey 
back in the forest where whisper persuade 
more sugar trail more white lady lay 
than pillar of salt 
fall to my arm hold they mesmeric sway 
and dance out to the moon as we do in those golden day 
christening star I remember the way 
we be needle and spoon mislaid in the burn hay 
bare on you tomb I be a prayer for you loneliness 
and would you ever soon come above unto I 
for once upon a time from the bind of you holiness 
I could always find the right slot for you sacred key 
six foot deep be the incision 
in my heart that barless prison 
discolor all with tunnel vision 
Nymphetamine 
sick and weak from my condition 
this lust this vampiric addiction 
to she alone in full submission 
Nymphetamine 
Nymphetamine 
Nymphetamine 
Nymphetamine nymphetamine 
nymphetamine girl 
Nymphetamine nymphetamine
