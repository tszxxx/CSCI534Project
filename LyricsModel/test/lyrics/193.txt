[Verse 1]
Yeah, it goes away
All of this and more of nothing in my life
No color clay
Individuality not safe
[Pre-Chorus 1]
As of now I bet you got me wrong
So unsure you run from something strong
[Verse 2]
I can't let go
Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow
Feel a tortured brain
Show your belly
 like you want me to
[Pre-Chorus 2]
As of now, I bet you got me wrong
So unsure, we reach for something strong
[Chorus]
I haven't felt like this in so long
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
That don't last forever
Something's gotta turn out right
[Verse 3]
You, sugar taste
Sweetness doesn't often touch my face
Stay if you please
You may not be here when I leave
[Pre-Chorus 2]
As of now, I bet you got me wrong
So unsure, we reach for something strong
[Outro]
I haven't felt like this in so long
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
That don't last forever
Something's gotta turn out right
