beat rapidly 
look down from here 
if I be to fall 
could I return 
incapacitate 
wall the speak to I 
word lose in the fire 
I will rise in smoke 
do not let I down let I go 
I will bide my time in vertigo 
do not let I down let I fall 
will not tie you up 
let I go let I fall 
I will bite my tongue 
will not let you break the fall 
find the horizon 
plant on the ground 
shadow changing form 
find it move
