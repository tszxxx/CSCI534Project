[Intro]
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me find my baby
Somebody help me find my baby right now
[Chorus]
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own
[Verse 1]
Well, someone to get up in the morning and rub my head
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
Someone to fix my breakfast and bring it to my bed
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
Someone to do a little housework and pamper me again
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
Like love and kisses and baby up 'til then
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
[Chorus]
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own
[Verse 2]
Well someone to be in my corner all the way now
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
Stick with me no matter what they say
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
I'll give my love to her all the time
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
I will gladly let her know she's mine all mine
(I'm looking for a love to call my own)
[Chorus]
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own
Get up baby
[Instrumental - Guitar Harmonica Organ solo]
Somebody help me find my baby
I said I've got to find my baby right now
And I'm looking in the morning, and I'm looking at night
Got to find my baby, she's nowhere in sight
I'm looking, I'm looking
I'm looking, I'm looking......
