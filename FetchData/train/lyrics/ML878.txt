[Chorus]
Kestrels breed
Looking farther than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me
Beacon don't fly too high
Beacon don't fly too high
[Verse 1]
For all your time
Playful crime in rain
Worth it being cold
Roofing for the lanes
A lesson lost again
A lesson lost again
[Verse 2]
Cute but I'll take the bus
With fees and favours gone
Cracks in savers pass
And a white that sometimes shone
Wanton borrowed gun
Wanton borrowed gun
[Chorus]
