[Verse 1]
I can hear her heartbeat
From a thousand miles
Hear the heavens open
Every time she smiles
And when I come to her
That's where I belong
Yet, I'm running to her
Like a river strong
[Chorus]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[Verse 2]
She's got a fine sense of humor
When I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her
When the sun goes down
Take my troubles away
Take away my grief
Take away my heartache
In the night like a thief
[Chorus]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[Bridge]
Yes I need, yes I need her in the daytime
And oh I need, yes I need her in the night
I want to throw my arms all around her
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight
And oh
[Verse 3]
And when I'm returning
From so far away
She gives me sweet sweet lovin'
Brighten up my day
It makes me righteous
And it makes me whole
Makes me mellow
Down into my soul
[Chorus]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, crazy love
One more time, she gives love, just a little love
When I wake up in the morning
She gives me love, love, love
Crazy Love
