now my road have turn to track 
Stones to pebble see they roll away 
my wander trouble need not break my back 
mmm sorrow be the price I pay 
I sing my sorrow to the morning I speak they to the night 
you best believe I will keep sing until I make my wrong so right 
Devil say a pity for you trouble to take you tired old soul 
so you know you get to go 
hurry to catch the morning 
you get to hurry on now 
in the night 
I would heed my sorrow 
and it know will n?t be long now 
hurry 
now with blind hand I crawl this lonely place 
as my dry tear fall and roll away 
I can not see trouble as they dance behind my back 
ooo sorrow be my soul to slay 
he steal my sorrow from the morning he rip they from the night 
and you best believe I will keep sing to make my wrong so right 
Devil take a pity of my trouble he hold my tired old soul 
so I know I get to go 
hurry to catch the morning 
I get to hurry on now 
in the night 
I would heed my sorrow 
now I know will n?t be long now 
hurry
