but I want he wing 
I can shine even in the darkness 
but I crave the light that he bring 
revel in the song that he sing 
my angel Gabriel 
I can love 
but I need he heart 
I be strong even on my own 
but from he I never want to part 
he be be there since the very start 
my angel Gabriel 
my angel Gabriel 
bless the day he come to be 
Angel 's wing carry he to I 
heavenly 
I can fly 
but I want he wing 
I can shine even in the darkness 
but I crave the light that he bring 
revel in the song that he sing 
my angel Gabriel 
my angel Gabriel 
my angel Gabriel
