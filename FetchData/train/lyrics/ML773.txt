[Chorus 1]
Yeah, and I'm just a waste of her energy
And she's just wasting my time, Mmhmmm
So why don't we get together
And we could waste everything tonight
And we could waste and we could waste it all tonight
Yeah, and we could waste and we could waste it all tonight
[Verse]
And I don't pretend to know what you know
No, no
Now please don't pretend to know what's on my mind
If we already knew everything that everybody knows
We would have nothing to learn tonight
And we would have nothing to show tonight
[Chorus 2]
Oh, but everybody thinks
That everybody knows
About everybody else
Nobody knows
Anything about themselves
Because they're all worried about everybody else
Yeah
Oh
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
