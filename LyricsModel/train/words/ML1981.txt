so sorry 
run through the past to you door 
I have be here before 
run to see what use I be for 
will not be here anymore 
heart after heart break 
and you be leave once more 
heart after heart break 
tear fall on the floor 
heart after heart break 
what good be I for 
heart after heart break 
what good be I for
