if I be never to leave here 
if I be always alone 
if I be never to see you 
if I could set the sun 
if I could set the sun 
keep movin 
keep changin 
keep flowin with the sun 
Rivers rise 
ocean rise 
people rise with the sun 
if I be never to leave here 
if I be always alone 
if I would never to see you 
if I could set the sun 
if I could set the sun 
tear fallin 
Rain fallin 
leave be fall with the sun 
life drifting 
seed drifting 
world drift with the sun 
if I be never to leave here 
if I be always alone 
if I be never to see you 
if I could set with the sunset say it 
if I 
never to leave here 
if I 
always alone 
if I 
ocean rise 
Rivers rise 
people rise 
with the sun 
ocean rise 
Rivers rise 
people rise 
with the sun
