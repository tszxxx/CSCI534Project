[Intro]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
[Verse 1]
I never, never had a dream come true
In my every dream, I'm loved by you
And we're free as the wind
And true love is no sin
Therefore, men are men, not machines
[Chorus]
I never, never had a dream come true
[Verse 2]
Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue
Since our roads never crossed
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams
[Chorus]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
I never, never had a dream come true
[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going to dream about you baby my whole life through
Seems my folks are ashamed
Said I ain't worth a thing
But I'm glad I'm chained to my dreams
[Outro]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Keep on dreaming
Do do do do do
Sing along with me
Do do do do do
Keep on dreaming
