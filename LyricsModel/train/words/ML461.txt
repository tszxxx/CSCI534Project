my love be warmer than a smile 
my love give to every need child 
if anyone should ask you who be my true love 
tell they my love true be ever let all they love come through 
my love see love with not a face 
and life to love through time and space 
if all of everything about my love fit to the tune of you 
then you can say that you be my love too 
let my love shine throughout the world 
to every mountain top and steeple 
let it be feel by every soul 
til love be all over 
let it reach out to every heart 
to every disenfranchise people 
til it be present and no more be pain all over 
we love see love be the key to peace 
we will pray til all world war have cease 
should you or anyone you know enough to say they feel as we 
then let we universal song be free 
let we love shine throughout the world 
to every mountain top and steeple 
let it be feel by every soul 
til love be all over 
let it reach out to every heart 
to every disenfranchise people 
til it be present and no more be pain all over 
say word of love to all we see 
to rich or poor for love be equal 
let we lift up humanity 
Spead love all over 
let all it 's force join as one 
so to rebuke all sign of evil 
through every valley land and sea 
we love 's all people
