I always leave she wait I always leave she down if she should come my way I always turn around please do not tell she I love she please do not tell she I love she I always keep she out I never let she in if she should come my way weep I greet she with a grin please do not tell she I love she please do not tell she I love she if she should discover the color of my love she will fly , fly away now you can try tenderness you can try to hang around oh , but I be sure she will love you less I be sure she will bring you down please do not tell she I love she please do not tell she I love she
