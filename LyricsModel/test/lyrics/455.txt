[Verse 1]
Way back when, in '67
I was 
the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?
[Chorus]
Hey Nineteen
No, we can't dance together (we can’t dance together)
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along when you slide on down
[Verse 2]
Hey Nineteen
That's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember the Queen of Soul
It's hard times befallen
The sole survivors
She thinks I'm crazy
But I'm just growing old...
[Chorus]
Hey Nineteen
No, we got nothing in common (we can’t dance together)
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along when you slide on down
[Instrumental break 1:50-2:40]
Nice!
Sure looks good!
Mmm mmm mmm
Skate a little lower, now
[Bridge]
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
(Say it again)
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
[Chorus]
No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along when you slide on down
[Post-Chorus]
No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at all
[Outro]
Sure looks good
Umm-umm-umm
Skate a little lower now
(The cuervo gold)
(The fine colombian)
(Make tonight a wonderful thing)
Say it again
(The cuervo gold)
(The fine colombian)
(Make tonight a wonderful thing)
(The cuervo gold)
(The fine colombian)
(Make tonight a wonderful thing)
(No we can't dance together)
(No we can't talk at all)
[Instrumental break 3:36-5:09]
