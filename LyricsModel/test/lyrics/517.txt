The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that tiem won't erase his name
The fact is
The only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl-and-boy-ment
Fall in love, you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it
Holdin' hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Oh â€“ Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
For it is
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waitin' at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Do,do,do...
Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?
Holdin' hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
And strollin' with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Da-da-da-da
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?
