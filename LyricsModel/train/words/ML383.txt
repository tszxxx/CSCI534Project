I do not feel the way I have ever feel 
I know 
gonna smile and not get worried 
I try but it show 
anyone can make what I have build and better now 
anyone can find the same white pill 
it take my pain away 
it be a lie a kiss with open eye 
and she be not breathe back 
anything but bother I 
never mind these be horrid time 
oh oh oh 
I can not let it bother I 
I never think I would walk away from you 
I do 
but it be a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit 
anyone can see my every flaw 
it be not hard 
anyone can say they be above this all 
it take my pain away 
it be a lie a kiss with open eye 
and she be not breathe back 
anything but bother I 
never mind these be hurry time 
oh oh oh 
I can not let it bother I 
I can not let it bother I 
it take my pain away 
it be a lie a kiss with open eye 
and she be not breathe back 
anything but bother I 
never mind these be hurry time 
oh oh oh 
I can not let it bother I 
take my pain 
take my pain 
take my pain 
take my pain away
