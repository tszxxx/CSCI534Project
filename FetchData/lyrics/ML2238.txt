[Verse 1]
You think you know me? you don't know shit!
I've seen the world through your eyes, and it makes me sick!
I've questioned all of your answers, they're fucking lies!
I won't conform to your system, I'd rather die!
[Chorus]
I burn it down, just to watch it go
I burn it down, so everybody knows
I burn it down, just to see it torched
I burn it down, I hate it to the core
[Verse 2]
Think you're a martyr? Not hard to see?
You want to rule the fucking world you got to get through me!
Your iron fist will be broken, no soul to sell!
You think I'll burn for my actions? See you in hell!
[Bridge]
I burn it down, I do it for myself
I burn it down, for me and no one else
I burn it down, just to watch it fall
I burn it down, I hate you fucking all
[Chorus]
I burn it down, just to watch it go
I burn it down, so everybody knows
I burn it down, just to see it torched
I burn it down, I hate it to the core
[Outro]
