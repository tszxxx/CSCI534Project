take the ribbon from my hair shake it loose and let it fall Lay it soft upon my skin like the shadow on the wall come and lay down by my side Til the early mornin ' light all I be takin ' be you time help I make it through the night Chorus : I do not care what 's right or wrong I will not try to understand let the devil take tomorrow but tonight I need a friend yesterday be dead and go and tomorrow 's out of sight and it 's sad to be alone help I make it through the night
