there be nothing to do here 
some just whine and complain 
in bed at the hospital 
come and go 
asleep and awake 
in bed at the hospital 
tell I the story of how you end up here 
I have hear it all in the hospital 
nurse be fussin 
doctor on tour 
somewhere in India 
I get one friend lay across from I 
I do not choose he he do not choose I 
we have get no chance of recovery 
share hospital joy and misery 
the joy and misery 
the joy and misery 
put out the fire boy do not stop do not stop 
put out the fire on we 
put out the fire boy do not stop do not stop 
put out the fire on we 
bring you bucket by the dozen 
bring you niece and you cousin 
come put out the fire on we 
Vietnam fishing trip

share hospital joy and misery
