I have be search for you 
I hear a cry within my soul 
I have never have a yearning quite like this before 
know that you be walk right through my door 
all of my life 
where have you be 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
and if that day come 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
a sacred gift of heaven 
for better worse wherever 
and I would never let somebody break you dow and 
until you cry never 
all of my life 
where have you be 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
and if that day come 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
at every time I have always know and 
that you be there 
upon you throne 
a lonely queen without she king 
I longe for you 
my love forever 
all of my life 
where have you be 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
and if that day come 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
all of my life 
where have you be 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
and if that day come 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
all of my life 
where have you be 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
and if that day come 
I know we could win 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again 
I wonder if I will ever see you again
