[Verse 1]
It was a Monday when my lover told me
Never pay the reaper with love only
What could I say to you, except I love you
And I'd give my life for yours
[Chorus]
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones, dear
[Verse 2]
The first time we made love, I, I wasn't sober
And you told me you love me over and over
How can I ever love another when I miss you everyday?
[Verse 3]
Remember the time we made love in the roses
And you took my picture in all sorts of poses?
How can I ever get over you when I'd give my life for yours?
[Chorus]
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones, dear
[Bridge]
My dear
It's time to say thank God for you
I thank God for you in each and every single way
I know (I know), I know (I know), I know, (I know), I know (I know)
It's time to let you know
Time to let you know
Time to let you know
Time to sit here and say
[Chorus - Outro]
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones
I know we are, we are the lucky ones, dear, dear
We are the lucky ones, dear, dear
We are the lucky ones, dear, dear
We are the lucky ones, dear
We are the lucky ones, dear
We are the lucky ones, dear
