[Verse 1]
Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in the rat race
And these days, that's a special way of life
(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
[Verse 2]
In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checker board
Old men tellin' lies and crownin' kings
Kids drivin' 'round the old town square
Cops roll down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen
(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
[Bridge]
When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised
Down home
Down home
[Chorus]
Folks know
If there fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
[Outro]
Down home
Way down home
Down home
Down home
Way down home
Down home
