[Verse 1]
You're like the warm sunshine, I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact, what do you say to that
You're always in my dreams, I think you know what they mean
My heart knows this is real at last, what do you say to that
[Chorus]
Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at, what do you say to that
[Bridge]
I promise I'll never leave, I'll always want you with me
Loving you won't ever be old hat, what do you say to that
[Chorus]
Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at, what do you say to that
[Verse 2]
You're like the warm sunshine, I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact, what do you say to that
My heart knows this is real at last, what do you say to that
