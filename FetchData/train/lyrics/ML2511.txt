[Verse 1]
I wake you up in the morning, baby
With a kick in the tit
I treat you like shit
You love it!
Smack you right in the face now, woman
Just to show you I care
And then I kick
Your pregnant ass down the stairs
[Chorus]
Slap, slap, slap you around
Slap, slap, slap you around
Slap, slap, slap you around
All day
All day, every fucking day
[Solo]
[Verse 2]
I pay the doctor bills, baby
So I'll break what I want (Oh I'm scared)
I spent all my money
In a fucking restaurant
I let you live in my house, now, woman
I take you out on the town
And I want some payback now, woman
I get to slap you around
[Chorus]
Slap, slap, slap you around
Slap, slap, slap you around
Kick ya, 'til ya fall down
All day
Slap, slap, slap you around
Slap, slap, slap you around
Beat ya while you're on the ground
All day
[Outro, spoken]
Ya know, one thing I'll never understand about you
No matter how many times I kick you in the teeth
Smack you with a manhole cover
Throw hot lard in your face
Pour molten glass into your rectum
You always
Come back for more
