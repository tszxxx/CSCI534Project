I be down on myself both day and night 
I could not get a thing to go just right 
I be hangin by my thumb and slippin on my foot 
I have to take a break I could not stand the heat 
just when I think I could never win 
I be do pretty good for the shape I be in 
I go to the movie last night again 
I could not stay long enough to see the end 
cause there be something go on that I could not see 
everybody be make out in the balcony 
I be miss out on the fun again 
but I be do pretty good for the shape I be in 
I try so hard to get back in the race 
I would just be satisfied if I could place 
there be so much competition but the best do not always win 
I be do pretty good for the shape I be in 
I go to a party and make a few pass 
one be a dream and the other be nasty 
well I guess you know by now that I do it again 
but I be do pretty good for the shape I be in 
I be down like a dollar comin up against a yen 
I be do pretty good for the shape I be in 
do pretty good for the shape I be in 
do pretty good for the shape I be in 
do pretty good for the shape I be in
