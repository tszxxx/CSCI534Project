the old hometown look the same as I step down from the train 
and there to meet I be my mama and papa 
and down the road I look and there run Mary hair of gold and lip like cherry 
it be good to touch the green green grass of home 
yes they will all come to meet I arm areach smile sweetly 
it be so good to touch the green green grass of home 
the old house be still stand though the paint be crack and dry 
and there be that old oak tree that I use to play on 
down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lip like cherry 
it be good to touch the green green grass of home 
then I awake and look around I at these four grey wall that surround I 
and I realize that I be only dream 
for there be a guard and there be that sad old padre arm in arm we will walk at daybreak 
and again I will touch the green green grass of home 
they will all come to see I in the shade of that old oak tree 
as they lay I neath the green green grass of home
