[Verse 1]
You need cooling, baby, I'm not fooling
I'm going to send you back to schooling
Way down inside honey, you need it
I'm going to give you my love[x2]
[Chorus:]
Want to Whole Lotta Love [4x]
You've been learning, baby, I bean learning
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been yearning
Way, way down inside honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love... I'm gonna give you my love
[Chorus]
You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling
All the good times I've been misusing
Way, way down inside, I'm going to give you my love
I'm going to give you every inch of my love
Going to give you my love
[Chorus]
Way down inside... woman... You need... love
[Outro]
Shake for me, girl. I want to be your backdoor man
Keep it cooling, baby
