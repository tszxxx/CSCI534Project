[Verse I]
Explosive
You feel the impact hit your face
What makes you think I'll let you survive
You want a war I'm the front line
Unbroken
[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me
I know you'll never get to me
You want a shot
I can take your best bring it on
Get ready for the pain
Cause this where it's going down
[Chorus]
War zone, war zone
This is where it's going down
War zone, war zone
When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
[Verse II]
Survival here is thrust upon you
Fuel the fire bring another victim
Take your lesson in supremacy
Cause I'm the one who stands alone at the summit
[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me
You know you'll never get to me
You want a shot
I can take your best bring it on
Get ready for the pain
Cause this is where it's going down
[Bridge]
I am the wall you can never climb
I am the pain that you feel inside
I bring it all let the show begin
I am the war you can never win
[Chorus]
War zone, war zone
This is where it's going down
War zone, war zone
When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way
Madness is coming your way
