love walk right in , and drive the shadow away love walk right in , and bring my sunniest day one magic moment , and my heart seem to know - that love say hello though not a word be speak one look , and I would forget the gloom of the past one look , and I have find my future at last one look , and I have find a world completely new when love walk in with you
