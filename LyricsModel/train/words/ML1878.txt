four letter word just to get I along 
it be a difficulty and I be bite on my tongue 
and I I keep stall not keep I together 
people around get to find something to say now 
holding back every day the same 
do not want to be a loner listen to I oh no 
I never say anything at all 
so with nothing to consider they forget my name 
they call I Hell 
they call I Stacey 
they call I she 
they call I Jane 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
they call I quiet girl 
but I be a riot 
Mary Jo-Lisa 
always the same 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
I miss the catch if they throw I the ball 
I be the last drip stand up against the wall 
keep up fall these heel they keep I boring 
get clamp up and sit on the fence now 
so alone all the time at night 
lock myself away listen to I I be not 
though I be dress up out and all 
with everything consider they forget my name 
they call I Hell 
they call I Stacey 
they call I she 
they call I Jane 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
they call I quiet girl 
but I be a riot 
Mary Jo-Lisa 
always the same 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
this song be in my head 
now it be in my mind 
call it reach it get some word and get some timing 
and though I realize 
I can not emphasize 
I will stick around but just do not promise nothing bind 
and baby can not you see 
that you be so desperately 
a standing joker like a vocal one liner 
instead of sing a long 
this song be monotone 
I have get to get some soul I get to get some feeling 
be you call I Darling 
be you call I bird 
be you call I Darling 
be you call I bird 
they call I Hell 
they call I Stacey 
they call I she 
they call I Jane 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
that be not my name 
they call I quiet girl 
but I be a riot
