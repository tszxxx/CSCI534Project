little darling it feel like year since it be be here

little darling it seem like year since it be be here 
here come the sun here come the sun 
and I say it be alright 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
Sun sun sun here it come 
little darling I feel that ice be slowly melt 
little darling it seem like year since it be be clear 
here come the sun here come the sun 
and I say it be alright
