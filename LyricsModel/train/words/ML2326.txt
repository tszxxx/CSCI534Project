dear I fear we be face a problem 
you love I no longer I know and 
maybe there be nothing that I can do 
to make you do 
mama tell I I should not bother 
that I ought just to stick to another man 
a man that surely deserve I 
but I think you do 
so I cry and I pray and I beg 
love I love I 
say that you love I 
fool I fool I 
go on and fool I 
love I love I 
pretend that you love I 
leave I leave I 
just say that you need I 
so I cry and I beg for you to 
love I love I 
say that you love I 
leave I leave I 
just say that you need I 
I can not care about anything but you 
lately I have desperately ponder 
spend my night awake and I wonder 
what I could have do in another way 
to make you stay 
reason will not lead to solution 
I will end up lose in confusion 
I do not care if you really care 
as long as you do not go 
so I cry and I pray and I beg 
love I love I 
say that you love I 
fool I fool I 
go on and fool I 
love I love I 
pretend that you love I 
leave I leave I 
just say that you need I 
so I cry and I beg for you to 
love I love I 
say that you love I 
leave I leave I 
just say that you need I 
I can not care about anything but you 
love I love I 
say that you love I 
fool I fool I 
go on and fool I 
love I love I 
I know that you need I 
I can not care about anything but you
