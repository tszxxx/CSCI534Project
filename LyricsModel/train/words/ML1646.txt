oh I be happy 
I be happy 
happy in Jesus 
he be the head of my life 
I be happy 
happy in Jesus 
from a world of sin 
he bring I out 
I be walk in darkness 
shackle in sin 
but Jesus save I 
and now I live for he 
I be happy 
I be happy 
I be happy 
happy in the Lord 
you do not know how happy I be 
on Christ the solid rock I stand 
you do not know what it mean to I 
to have he Holy ghost abide in I 
step in the water 
the water be cold 
it chill my body 
but not my soul 
I be so happy 
I be happy 
I be happy 
happy in the Lord 
one of these old morning 
will not be very long 
you go to look for I 
and I will be go on home 
but I will be happy 
yes I will 
I will be happy 
oh happy 
happy in the Lord 
I be happy 
happy in Jesus
