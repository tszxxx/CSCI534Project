[Chorus]
Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love
[Verse 1]
I spent a night
Just another chance to see you
Just you and I
Wanted you to know
That my playing days are over
Because all I do is think of you
The writing's on the wall
[Chorus]
Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love
[Verse 2]
I've been out in the world (oh oh)
Yes, the fast life had me going
Now all that's changed (hmm hmm)
I finally make up my mind
About the one thing
I've been knowing
You're the only girl
I've ever cared for in this world (oh oh)
[Chorus]
Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love
[Bridge]
You kind of love is forever
It took me a long time to realize (to realize)
That I've come so far
And end up going nowhere
Oh, girl, I need you by my side (oh oh oh)
[Chorus]
Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you (coming home to you)
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love
All my love
