there will be no string to bind you hand 
not if my love can not bind you heart 
there be no need to take a stand 
for it be I who choose to start 
I see no need to take I home 
I be old enough to face the daw and 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
just touch my cheek before you leave I baby 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
then slowly turn away from I 
maybe the sun 's light will be dim 
and it will not matter anyhow 
if morning 's echo say we have sin 
well it be what I want now 
and if we be victim of the night 
I will not be blind by the light 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
just touch my cheek before you leave I baby 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
then slowly turn away I will not beg you to stay with I 
through the tear of the day of the year baby 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
just touch my cheek before you leave I baby 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
just touch my cheek before you leave I darling 
just call I angel of the morning angel 
just touch my cheek before you leave I darl
