It's real low down and it's kinda mean
The Dirty Boogie, the Dirty Boogie
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
The Dirty Boogie, what's it called?
The Dirty Boogie hey you all
The Dirty Boogie, how's it go?
The Dirty Boogie, not too slow
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
Well, you rattle and shake, you moan and groan
A girl like you I could never bring home
The Dirty Boogie, the Dirty Boogie
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
The Dirty Boogie, what's it called?
The Dirty Boogie, hey you all
The Dirty Boogie, how's it go?
The Dirty Boogie, not too slow
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
Well, they're shakin' their hips and scream and shout
And doin' things I can't even talk about
Dirty Boogie, catch my drift, the Dirty Boogie
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
The Dirty Boogie, what's it called?
The Dirty Boogie, hey you all
The Dirty Boogie, well, how's it go?
The Dirty Boogie, not too slow
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
When I get low down, it's the Dirty Boogie for me
