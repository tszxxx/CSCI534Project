hi 
scar will heal soon 
the dregs in we spend the earth down 
better than drow in a burlap sack 
I live as Alice I die 
Children should not play with dead thing 
foaming crow 
tear at they wing 
sad eye cry crimson blood 
Drop it it be dead 
wheel will not turn they will not turn the birdy 's head 
sad eye sad eye like sharpen dagger 
you will never walk only stagger 
sad eye quite cryptic 
Bye
