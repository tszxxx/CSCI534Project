have yourself a merry little Christmas 
let you heart be light 
next year all we trouble will be out of sight 
have yourself a merry little Christmas 
make the yuletide gay 
next year all we trouble will be mile away 
once again as in olden day 
happy golden day of yore 
faithful friend who be dear to we 
will be near to we once more 
someday soon we all will be together 
if the fate allow 
until then we will have to muddle through somehow 
so have yourself a merry little Christmas now
