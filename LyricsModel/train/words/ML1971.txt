long night no sleep 
let 's not turn alarm clock on 
call wait on my machine 
papers pile up on the front lawn 
love and happiness ruin my ambition 
love and happiness 
love and happiness that be my condition 
love love love love and happiness 
take you time stay for breakfast 
and tell I why that tattoo 
why drive home this morning 
my shirt look good on you 
love and happiness ruin my ambition 
love and happiness 
love and happiness that be my condition 
love love love love and happiness 
who be the president 
I do not care 
who be the monkey who be the mayor 
what be the story 
what be the news 
what be the difference 
all I want be you 
I do not want to leave this feeling 
I do not want to leave this house 
I turn myself in with you and 
only you can turn I out 
love and happiness ruin my ambition 
love and happiness 
love and happiness that be my condition 
love love love love love 
love and happiness 
love love love love love and happiness
