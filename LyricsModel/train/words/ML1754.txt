a little girl upon the fireplace 
only air fly emotionless 
ring the bell for she could keep fly 
this be I completely I 
end of day we watch the sun go down 
but I can see you be like a firework 
you want to save I people will save I 
but this be you completely you 
now it be day but I be dream 
a man walk by I want to be he wife 
I be only here sometimes 
under the tree of life 
I be only good sometimes 
take my time to go home 
like a candle waste from burn 
I get shoe tired from walking 
call out you name my lip keep fail 
they have now forget to sing 
now it be day but I be dream 
a man walk by I want to be he wife 
I be only here sometimes 
under the tree of life 
I be only good sometimes 
take my time to go home 
I be only here sometimes 
under the tree of life 
I be only good sometimes 
take my time to go home 
I be only here sometimes 
under the tree of life 
I be only here sometimes 
take my time to go home
