[Verse 1]
I'm so sick of me, being sick of you
And the way you look, all the things you do
You drive me crazy, drive me crazy
Sick of being broke, can't pay for shit
I'm about to snap, I can't handle it
I'm going crazy, going crazy (going crazy)
[Chorus]
If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now
Gotta break it up
And just let it out
If I was sick like you
I would feed the fire
I would light it up
And watch it all come down
[Verse 2]
I'm so sick of my life
It's the same old shit
Try to make it bend
But it never gives
Look what you made me
What you made me
I hate my boss
He's a little bitch
If he keeps it up
I'll make him quit
Or I'll go crazy
I'm going crazy
[Chorus]
If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now
Gotta break it up
And just let it out
If I was sick like you
I would feed the fire
I would light it up
And watch it all come down
And watch it all come down
[Post-Chorus]
I'm so sick of me, being sick of you
And the way you look, all the things you do
You drive me crazy, drive me crazy
Yeah!
[Chorus]
If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now
Gotta break it up
And just let it out
If I was sick like you
I would feed the fire
I would light it up
And watch it all come down
[Outro]
(If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now)
There's no stopping now
(And atch it all come down)
(If you're sick like me)
If you're sick like me
