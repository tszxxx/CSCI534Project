get a ticket on the mainline 
I be strand on the fault line 
I get waste on the moonshine 
too far go 
I be walk in the sundown 
I be head for the breakdown 
when you be sleep on the cold ground 
too far go 
there be a cloud hanging over I 
something just reach out and grab a hold of I 
inside of the belly of the whale 
outside they be beatin on the door 
somebody goin down tonight 
I say boy he do not live here no more 
he do not live here no more 
I be ride on the night train 
I be move in the fast lane 
I be only try to kill the pain 
too far go 
I be run on a red light 
always look for a street fight 
I be higher than a lose kite 
too far go 
when you be wait for the axe to drop 
when you be hook so bad you could not stop 
inside of the belly of the whale 
outside they be beatin on the door 
somebody goin down tonight 
I say boy he do not live here no more 
he do not live here no more 
get no one to blame but myself 
they could not hear my distant cry for help 
inside of the belly of the whale 
outside they be beatin on the door 
somebody be goin down tonight 
I say boy he do not live here no more 
he do not live here no more
