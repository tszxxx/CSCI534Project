[Verse 1]
Misery is all we know lately
Saturdays are all the same
Sympathy is overrated
Like a snapshot when you've lost the game
[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us both
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us both
[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna get thrown in your ocean
Don't try, you know that we already know it
It's over
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry at your own burial
[Verse 2]
Thinking of my 81st birthday
Every day this body goes to waste
Remembering how I would raise an army
When we went back to your place
[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us both
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us both
[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna get thrown in your ocean
Don't try, you know that we already know it
It's over
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry at your own burial
At your own burial
Donâ€™t forget to cry at your own burial
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry
At your own burial
