[Verse 1]
Midnight, gettin' uptight, where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown
[Pre-Chorus]
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away
[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh
[Verse 2]
Daylight, spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through
Hey, man, bet you can treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite
[Pre-Chorus]
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away
[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away
[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh
[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh
[Outro]
I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
I hate myself for loving you
