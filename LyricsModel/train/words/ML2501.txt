you ask I if there will come a time 
when I grow tired of you 
never my love 
never my love 
you wonder if this heart of mine 
will lose it 's desire for you 
never my love 
never my love 
what make you think love will end 
when you know that my whole life depend 
on you 
never my love 
never my love 
you say you fear I will change my mind 
and I will not require you 
never my love 
never my love 
how can you think love will end 
when I have ask you to spend you whole life 
with I
