I do not want you baby 
I do not need you lately 
love be ever change 
and I think you be crazy 
oh girl I have get to let you let you let you go 
let I touch you daisy 
give I what I can not be 
let tomorrow face I 
love I kill I change I 
oh girl I have get to let you let you let you go 
see I be a jumper baby 
mama do not forsake I 
madness can not contain I 
if you love I chase I 
oh girl I have get to let you let you let you go 
girl I have get to let you let you let you 
girl I have get to let you let you let you go
