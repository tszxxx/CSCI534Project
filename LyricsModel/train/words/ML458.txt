take a breath take it deep 
calm yourself he say to I 
if you play you play for keep 
take the gun and count to three 
I be sweat now move slow 
no time to think my turn to go 
and you can see my heart beating 
you can see it through my chest 
Said I be terrified but I be not leave 
I know that I must pass this test 
so just pull the trigger 
say a prayer to yourself 
he say close you eye 
sometimes it help 
and then I get a scary thought 
that he be here mean he be never lose 
and you can see my heart beating 
oh you can see it through my chest 
Said I be terrified but I be not leave 
know that I must pass this test 
so just pull the trigger 
as my life flash before my eye 
I be wonder will I ever see another sunrise 
so many will not get the chance to say goodbye 
but it be too late to think of the value of my life 
and you can see my heart beating 
ouh oh you can see it through my chest 
Said I be terrified but I be not leave no 
know that I must pass this test 
you can see my heart beating 
oh you can see it through my chest 
I be terrified but I be not leave no no 
know that I must pass this test 
so just pull the trigger
