I'm from South Street Philadelphia
I'm from from Avenue C
I've seen empty eyes
That was waiting to freeze
I'm from the Bowery, too!
I don't care about you!
Fuck you!
I don't care about you!
I've seen Hollywood Boulevard
Welfare hotel
I spent the night in jail
In the Wilcox hotel!
I don't care about you!
Fuck you!
I don't care about you!
I've seen a old man have a heart attack in Manhattan
Well he died while we just stood there lookin' at him
Ain't he cute?
I don't care about you!
Ohhhhhhhhh!
I don't care about you!
I've seen men rollin' drunks
Bodies in the the street
I saw a man that was sleepin' in puke
And a man with no legs crawling down 5th street trying to get something to eat!
I don't care about you!
Oh noooooo!!
I don't care about you!
Fuck you!
I don't care about you!
Hey! Hey!
I don't care about you!
