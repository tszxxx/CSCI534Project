underneath the darken sky 
drift through a sea of lie 
pull into the under tow 
my body drag deep below 

give I strength to push on through 
give I strength 
seek shelter from the storm 
carry I when i can not go on 
uplift my spirit 
so i carry on 
be once lose 
but now i be find 
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn 
push on through 
fight for life 
fight for life 
my word 
be not with fear 
but with the spirit 
in unrest 
I fear no man 
I fear not death 
I fear no man 
I will prevail 
give I strenght to carry on 
push on through the light of daw and 
carry I when i can not go on 
uplift my spirit 
so i carry on 
be once lose 
but now i be find 
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn 
push on through 
fight for life 
fight for life 
push on through 
fight for life 
push on through 
fight for life 
push on through
