Sunshine on my shoulder make I happy Sunshine in my eye can make I cry Sunshine on the water look so lovely Sunshine almost always make I high if I have a day that I could give you I would give to you the day just like today if I have a song that I could sing for you I would sing a song to make you feel this way Sunshine on my shoulder make I happy Sunshine in my eye can make I cry Sunshine on the water look so lovely Sunshine almost always make I high if I have a tale that I could tell you I would tell a tale sure to make you smile if I have a wish that I could wish for you I would make a wish for sunshine for all the while Sunshine on my shoulder make I happy Sunshine in my eye can make I cry Sunshine on the water look so lovely Sunshine almost always make I high Sunshine almost all the time make I high Sunshine almost always
