[Verse 1]
Boy meets girl (meets girl)
You were my dream, my world (my world)
But I (But I) was blind (Was blind)
You cheated on me from behind
So on (So on) my own (My own)
I feel so all alone
Though I know it's true (It's true)
I'm still in love with you
[Chorus]
I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me
I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me, it can happen to me
[Post-Chorus]
Miracle (Miracle)
[Verse 2]
Day (Day) and night (And night)
I'm always by your side (By your side)
'Cause I know ('Cause I know) for sure (For sure)
My love is real, my feelings pure
So take (So take) a try (A try)
No need to ask me why (Ask me why)
'Cause I know ('Cause I know) it's true (It's true)
I'm still in love with you
[Chorus]
I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me
I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me, it can happen to me
[Outro]
Miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
