[Verse 1]
Want you to stay in a subtle way
Like you're walking again, all on me
Step slowly, you know that you fall between
Dark places
, 
what a simple web we weave
[Chorus]
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
[Refrain]
Know my soul! Soul!
Know my soul!
[Verse 2]
Well, all hail the prison queen
Iron bars, iron heart
Iron bars, everything
A hundred years old
A hundred years old
Last on the village scene
Fall apart, iron heart
More alive than you've ever been
[Chorus]
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
[Hook]
Well, it's a dull life, it's a dull life
It's a dull life, it's a dark place
It's a dull life, it's a dull life
It's a dull life, it's a dull life
[Refrain]
Know my soul!
[Bridge]
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
[Chorus]
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
[Refrain / Outro]
Know my soul!
