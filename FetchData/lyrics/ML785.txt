[Verse 1: Tom Araya]
Propaganda death ensemble, burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night, in blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
, the reason for the siege
The pendulum it shaves the blade, the strafing air blood raid
[Verse 2: Tom Araya]
Infiltration push reserves, encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy, playing on the minds
Bombard till submission, take all to their graves
Indication of triumph: the numbers that are dead
[Chorus: Tom Araya]
Sport the war!
War support!
The sport is war, total war
When victory's really massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill
[Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Chorus: Tom Araya]
Sport the war!
War support!
The sport is war, total war
When victory's really survival
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill
[Bridge 1: Tom Araya]
Be dead, be from above
When darkness falls
Descend onto my sights
Your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground
[Bridge 2: Tom Araya]
Regime prophetic age
Old in its time
Flowing veins run on through
Deep in the Rhine
Center of the web
All battles scored
What is our war crimes
Era forever more
WAR!!
[Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 3: Tom Araya]
Propaganda war ensemble, burial to be
Bones shining by the night, in blood laced misery
Campaign of elimination, twisted psychology
When victory is to survive, and death is defeat
[Chorus: Tom Araya]
Sport the war!
War support!
The sport is war, total war
When the end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill
