I be a poor wayfaring stranger travel through this world alone there be no sickness , toil nor danger in that fair land to which I go I be goin ' home to see my mother I be goin ' home , no more to roam I be just goin ' over Jordan I be just goin ' over home I know dark cloud will hover o'er I I know my pathway be rough and steep but golden field lie out before I where weary eye no more will weep I be goin ' home to see my father I be goin ' home , no more to roam I be just goin ' over Jordan I be just goin ' over home I will soon be free from every trial this form shall rest beneath the sod I will drop the cross of self - denial and enter in that home with God I be go home to see my Savior I be goin ' home , no more to roam I be just goin ' over Jordan I be just goin ' over home
