be not it a pity 
be not it a shame 
how we break each other 's heart 
and cause each other pain 
how we take each other 's love 
without think anymore 
forget to give back 
now be not it a pity 
some thing take so long 
but how do I explain 
when not too many people 
can see we be all the same 
and because of all they tear 
you eye can not hope to see 
the beauty that surround they 
now be not it a pity 
be not it a pity 
now be not be a shame 
how we break each other 's heart 
and cause each other pain 
how we take each other 's love 
without think anymore 
forget to give back 
now be not it a pity
