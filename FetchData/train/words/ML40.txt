be you ready ? this place inside my mind a place I like to hide you do not know the chance what if I should die ? a place inside my brain another kind of pain you do not know the chance I be so blind Blind Blind another place I find to escape the pain inside you do not know the chance what if I should die ? a place inside my brain another kind of pain you do not know the chance I be so blind Blind Blind deeper , and deeper , and deeper as I journey to live a life that seem to be a lose reality that can never find a way to reach my inner ... self - esteem be low how deep can I go in the ground that I lay if I do not find a way to see through the gray that cloud my mind this time I look to see what 's between the line I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind [ Chorus : Jonathan Davis &amp ; head ] I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind I can not see , I can not see , I be go blind ! I be blind ! I be blind ! I be blind ! I be blind !
