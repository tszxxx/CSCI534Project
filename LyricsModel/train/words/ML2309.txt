I be down for so long 
everything I do be wrong 
and I find fault 
in everyone but I 
I be hurt and alone 
I could not find my way home 
break down and hungry 
and too tired to moan 
then I hear somebody call my name 
say be not no need to be shame 
I find out that the door be always open 
I be trap in my mind 
a prisoner of my own design 
lose in a world 
a world of confusion 
I be there by myself 
could not find no help no where else 
think I would call up the hotline 
but there be nobody there 
then I hear somebody call my name 
say be not no need to be shame 
I find out that the door be always open 
then I hear somebody call my name 
say be not no need to be shame 
I find out that the door be always open
