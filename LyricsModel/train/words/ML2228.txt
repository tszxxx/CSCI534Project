watch for hour 
like wilting flower 
blame it on something 
pour it over 
fall like soldier 
think of nothing 
blank in you head cos it be hard to believe 
and the ache in you bone go from chest to you foot 
blank in you head cos it be hard to believe 
and the ache in you bone go from chest to you foot 
blank in you head yeah it be hard to accept 
the loss that you feel be not easy to heal 
blank in you head yeah it be hard to believe 
and the ache in you bone go from chest to you foot 
do not really matter what be say 
I will not believe it I will not believe it 
turn my back I turn my head 
I will not believe it I will not believe it 
I can not say another word 
I can not breathe another lung 
shut my eye the world be go 
I will not believe it I will not believe it 
skin full of indent 
make a entrance 
mind be in circle 
unravel you tongue 
smil that you have win 
it be not that simple 
blank in you head cos it be hard to believe 
and the ache in you bone go from chest to you foot 
blank in you head cos it be hard to believe 
and the ache in you bone go from chest to you foot 
blank in you head yeah it be hard to accept 
the loss that you feel be not easy to heal 
blank in you head yeah it be hard to believe 
and the ache in you bone go from chest to you foot 
do not really matter what be say 
I will not believe it I will not believe it 
turn my back I turn my head 
I will not believe it I will not believe it 
I can not say another word 
I can not breathe another lung 
shut my eye the world be go 
I will not believe it I will not believe it
