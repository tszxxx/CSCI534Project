well it be late and you know I have be up drinkin 
talkin to myself up and down the hall 
be not it great another fabulous disaster 
well I can not wait for the next hammer fall 
you may have win this battle baby 
but it do not mean I will not win the war 
and you you do not even know what it be that you be fightin for 
well it be early I know you have be up waitin 
waitin for I to finally call 
talkin dirty it be not what you really want 
to slam another phone up against the wall 
you may have win this battle baby 
but it do not mean I will not win the war 
and you you do not even know what it be that you be fightin for 
well think about I when you be out there honey 
you know sometimes that I will 
sometimes I feel like a broken stone rollin down you hill 
you may have win this battle baby 
but it do not mean I will not win the war 
and you you do not even know what it be that you be fightin for
