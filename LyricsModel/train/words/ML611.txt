look like it be over 
you know I could not stay 
she be come home today 
we have a good thing 
I will miss you sweet love 
why must you look at I that way 
it be over 
sad eye turn the other way 
I do not want to see you cry 
sad eye you know there would come a day 
when we would have to say goodbye 
try to remember 
the magic that we share 
in time you broken heart will mend 
I never use you 
you know I really care 
I hate to sit and defend 
but it be over 
sad eye turn the other way 
I do not want to see you cry 
sad eye you know there would come a day 
when we would have to say goodbye 
sad eye turn the other way 
I do not want to see you cry 
sad eye you know there would come a day 
when we would have to say goodbye 
sad eye turn the other way 
I do not want to see you cry 
sad eye you know there would come a day 
when we would have to say goodbye 
sad eye turn the other way
