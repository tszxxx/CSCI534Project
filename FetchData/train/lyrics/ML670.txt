You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seems
But I wish I could, so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
With my heart
(Before you tear us apart)
My heart
(Quit playin' games with my heart)
I should've known from the start
(Before you got in my heart)
From my heart
(Quit tearing us apart)
My heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
I live my life the way
...
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
...
So what is it that you can't see?
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
...
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could, so bad, baby, you better
...
Quit playing games with my heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
With my heart
(Before you tear us apart)
My heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
I should've known from the start
(Before you got in my heart)
From my heart
(Quit tearing us apart)
My heart
Quit playing games
Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hanging here forever
Oh baby, baby, this is not right, let's stop this tonight
Baby, oh, quit playing games
(Na na, na na, na na na)
(Na na, na na, na na, baby)
(Na na, na na, na na na)
...
Sometimes I wish, I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could, so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
With my heart
(Before you tear us apart)
My heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
I should've known from the start
(Before you got in my heart)
From my heart
(Quit tearing us apart)
My heart
(Quit playing games with my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
(Na na, na na, na na na)
(Na na, na na, na na, baby)
(Na na, na na, na na na)
Quit playing games with my heart
(Na na, na na, na na na)
With my heart
(Na na, na na, na na, baby)
My heart, my heart
