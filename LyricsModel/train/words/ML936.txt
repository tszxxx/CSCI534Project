never think gettin burn could be so much fun 
always comin up with something new 
yeah that woman teach I a thing or two

no sooner set the brake she jump on top of I 
she be on fire 
my baby 's on fire

straight home from school she start to get undressed

I get so hot every time she come near 
turn on to love like it be the latest style 
I get response from just a look with a smile
