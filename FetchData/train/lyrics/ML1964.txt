[Verse 1]
It's going on five, I want you to know
My spirit's alive, I want you to know
[Chorus]
I'm getting down with the awkward moments
I'm getting down with the sour kiss
I'm getting down with the rumors in the back of the car
I'm getting down with it
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
[Verse 2]
Signal when you get to the top
Signal when you want me, when you want me to stop
We could, we could crash
We could, we could burn burn
We could take it, we could we could take it, take it in turns
[Chorus]
Getting down
Getting down with your new vocation
Getting down with your cute cut wrists
I'm getting down with the kisses and cross-stitches on it
I'm getting down with it
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
[Bridge]
Here's a message from my old coat pocket
My spirit's alive and I want you to know
[Chorus]
I'm getting down with the young drunk lovers
I'm getting down with the one-way pact
I'm getting down with the city and the pity of it
I'm getting down with it
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh aaah, Uh-uh uh-uh aaah
[Outro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh, uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh, uh-uh aaah
Uh-uh, uh-uh aaah
