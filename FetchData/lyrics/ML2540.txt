This songs to all the people
With light in their hearts
And love in their eyes
You don't have to worry
When the mountains seem of infinite size
There is one who goes before you to calm the sea
There's a king who leads his people to victory
We are Destined to Win
We're surrounded by his Love
And guarded by his power
Destined to Win
Following the Lord until the battles over
We are Destined to Win
We all get discouraged
When the pressures of life start weighing us down
We've learned that in his footsteps
Crosses in life must preceed the crowns
There is one who goes before you
To calm the sea
There's a king who leads his people to victory
We are Destined to Win
We're surrounded by his Love
And guarded by his power
Destined to Win
Following the Lord until the battles over
We are Destined to Win
We've got to remember
It's our destiny to win the end
With Christ on our side
We are Destined to Win
We are Destined to Win
We're surrounded by his Love
And guarded by his power
Destined to Win
Following the Lord until the battles over
Destined to Win
We're surrounded by his Love
And guarded by his power
Destined to Win
Following the Lord until the battles over
We are Destined
We are Destined
We are Destined to Win
