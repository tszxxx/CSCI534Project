and a happy new year 
give everyone you blessin 
and spread the good cheer 
the best gift you can give 
be the gift of love 
it be what the whole world need 
be what we be dream of 
so light up the fire 
walk through the snow 
come and stand with I now 
under the mistletoe 
we all need some Christmas love 
go to get my Christmas love 
we all need some Christmas love 
Children wrap you present 
put they underneath the tree 
if everybody give 
then everyone receive 
I see you pretty face 
in the Christmas light 
Children be excited 
cause Santa come tonight 
so light up the fire 
walk through the snow 
come and stand with I now 
under the mistletoe 
we all need some Christmas love 
go to get my Christmas love 
we all need some Christmas love 
well I see Santa 's be here 
there be a smile on my face

put they right in they place

across the moon 
he will be at you chimney 
any time soon 
so light up the fire 
walk through the snow 
come and stand with I now 
under the mistletoe

go to get my Christmas love
