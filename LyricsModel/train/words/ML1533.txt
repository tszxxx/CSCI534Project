suppose you be to die tonight what would you say 
do you believe in life after death 
in the chill of the night 
I can feel my heart racing 
as I run towards the light 
that seem so far away 
wonder forever 
in the darkest of shadow 
wonder if I will ever see you again 
wonder if I will ever see you again 
I will take you love 
I will take you hate 
I will take you desire 
I will take the world 
when it turn on you 
I will set it on fire 
W the with th th the walking dead 
the walking dead 
dig in the dirt 
I can feel you get closer 
steady my hand through the blistering pain 
anxiously await for the earth to reveal you 
wonder if I will ever see you again 
wonder if I will ever see you again 
I will take you love 
I will take you hate 
I will take you desire 
I will take you heart 
I will take you pain 
I will bring you to life 
I will bring you to life 
W the with th th the walking dead 
the walking dead 
I will bring you to life 
I will take you love 
I will take you hate 
I will take you desire 
I will take the world 
when it turn on you 
W the with th th the walking dead 
I will take you love 
I will take you hate 
I will take you desire 
I will take you heart 
I will take you pain 
I will bring you to life 
there be no such thing as death 
there be only change change change change
