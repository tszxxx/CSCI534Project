so cold that you can not cope 
with a frozen heart 
I guess we blow apart 
I guess it from the start 
stay in shadow 
I will run this world out 
stay in shadow 
it be run out of time 
stay in shadow 
I want to watch it drow 
stay in this now 
do not say because you can not 
say what we should have be 
do not show what I resent 
do not know cause I forget 
so cruel to be so blind 
Darkness be on my side 
now that you have come and go 
I know where I belong 
stay in shadow 
I will run this world out 
stay in shadow 
it be run out of time 
stay in shadow 
I want to watch it drow 
stay in this now 
light be leave as I watch you go 
light be leave inside of my soul 
light be leave as I watch you go 
light be leave inside of my soul 
stay in shadow 
I will run this world out 
stay in shadow 
it be run out of time 
stay in shadow 
I want to watch it drow 
stay in this now 
I want to watch it drow 
I want to watch it drow
