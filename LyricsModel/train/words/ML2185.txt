God rest you merry gentleman 
let nothing you dismay 
remember Christ we savior 
be bear on Christmas Day 
to save we all from Satan 's power 
when we be go astray 
in Bethlehem in Jewry 
this bless Babe be bear 
and lay within a manger 
upon this bless morn 
the which he mother Mary 
do nothing take in scorn 
from God we Heavenly Father 
a bless angel come 
and unto certain shepherd 
bring tideng of the same 
how that in Bethlehem be bear 
the Son of God by name 
of tideng of comfort and joy
