bring it on 
in the absence 
I will introduce my wrath 
my malice 
wicked cancer grow beneath the surface 
head to finger 
you make I sick 
hate on my freedom 
it do not matter 
what you say 
it eat away 
I be the hunt 
I be the atrocity 
the only chance my kin survive 
I be the hunt 
I be the atrocity 
the only chance my kin survive 
this be a war of attrition 
bring it on 
bring it on 
bring it on 
this be a war of attrition 
no we be the voice of tomorrow 
no to lie and deception 
no to the chokehold of despair 
no it eat away 
this be a war of attrition 
bring it on 
bring it on 
bring it on 
this be a war of attrition 
in the return from disenchantment 
there be but one thing on he mind 
how have it come to this 
all that be remember 
cast into the landscape search for he retribution 
retribution the only chance 
Blood will spill 
Blood will spill 
bow down to you master 
retribution 
retribution 
bring it on 
this be a war of attrition 
attrition 
this be a war of attrition
