[Verse 1: 
Martina Sobara
]
I like that outfit, the zipper's pinchin'
But if you want it any tighter, we could cinch it
Dress up in leather, wear every color
I'm going loco-co with sequins in the summer
[Pre-Chorus: Martina Sobara]
So come
Twirl your dresses around
Lift your cotton socks on
And turn your cameras on now for the fun
[Chorus: Martina Sobara]
While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor
While I light a fire
I light a fire
[Verse 2: Martina Sobara]
Buttons are busted, we're decorated
We make an ornament with gold and silver plating
So what's the latest, we raise a fever
We're just all red inside, that's all there is to see here
Yeah, we're red inside, we're all red inside
And the leg bone's connected to the one in the thigh
We are red inside, we're all red inside
And the leg bone's connected to the one in the thigh
[Pre-Chorus: Martina Sobara]
So come oh, oh, oh
Twirl your dresses around, 'ound, 'ound, 'ound
Lift your cotton socks on, on, on, on, on
Turn your cameras on, oh, oh, oh, oh...
[Chorus: Martina Sobara]
While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor
While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor
While I light a fire
I light a fire
