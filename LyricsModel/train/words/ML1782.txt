when the evenin sun go down 
you go to find I hangin round 
the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life 
many people just like I 
dreamin of what use to be 's 
oh the night life it be not no good life 
but it be my life 
listen to the blue they be playin 
listen what the blue be sayin 
mine be just another scene 
from the world of broken dream 
the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life 
listen to the blue they be playin 
listen what the blue be sayin 
mine be just another scene 
from the world of broken dream 
and the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life 
the night life it be not no good life 
but it be my life
