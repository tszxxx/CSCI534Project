send I the pillow that you dream on do not you know that I still care for you 
send I the pillow that you dream on so darl I can dream on it too 
each night while I be sleep oh so lonely 
I share you love in dream that once be true 
send I the pillow that you dream on so darl I can dream on it too 
send I the pillow that you dream on maybe time will let we dream come true 
send I the pillow that you dream on so darl I can dream on it too 
I have wait so long for you to write I but just a mem'ry 's all that be leave of you 
send I the pillow that you dream on so darl I can dream on it too 
so darl I can dream on it too
