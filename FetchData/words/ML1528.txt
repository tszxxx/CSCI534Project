Strap my derriere to a padded chair I fly the air in a tin can from here to there on a wing and a prayer I do not even know where I be I be a wanderin fool burnin fossil fuel send arrow into the dark but I be just lookin for a place where I can fall apart throw all of my junk into the Alamo trunk and I pull out into the lane cell phone 's dead there 's mountain ahead I do not even slow down for the rain there be a time when the road be mine and the path be line with spark now I be just lookin for a place where I can fall apart it 's in the air the scent of despair nobody want to talk about it we be all scared we be go to lose we share of the dream can not live without it my clothes be funky I be a sugar junkie I be a promo monkey in a cage I lunge for the carrot repeat like a parrot Til I step out onto the stage the light go down and I see you face Shinin through the dark and I be just lookin for a place where I can fall apart oh can I let my guard down tonight ? be it safe enough to fall apart ?
