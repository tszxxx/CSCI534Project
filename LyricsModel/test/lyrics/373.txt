[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I had a peace dream
You know how real dreams can be
The world was a better place
For you and me, can't you see?
[Chorus]
No need for war no more
Better things we're fighting for
No more hunger, no more pain
I hope I have that dream again
[Verse 1]
Can you imagine all of this coming through?
It's really up to all of us to do
Just like John Lennon said in Amsterdam from his bed
"One day the world will wake up to see the reality"
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
No need for war no more
Better things we're fighting for
No more hunger, no more pain
I hope the dreams comes true someday
[Verse 2]
So try to imagine
If we give peace a chance
All the world could be living in harmony
One day our dream could be reality, reality
[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I had a peace dream
You know how real dreams can be
The world was a better place
For you and me
[Chorus]
