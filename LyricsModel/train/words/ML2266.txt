I promise I will never leave I will always want you with I 
loving you will not ever be old hat what do you say to that

love be never really love without you 
here beside you be really where it be at what do you say to that 
you be like the warm sunshine I think of you all the time 
I have fall for you and that be a fact what do you say to that 
my heart know this be real at last what do you say to that
