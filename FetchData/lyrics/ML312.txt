[Intro: A.J]
Yeah
[Verse 1: Brian &amp; 
Nick
]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
[Chorus: Nick &amp; 
All
]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way
[Verse 2: AJ, 
with Brian
]
Am I your 
fire?
Your one 
desire
Yes, I know 
it's too late
But I want it that way
[Chorus: AJ, 
All
 &amp; 
Brian
]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way
[Bridge: Kevin]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
[Interlude: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)
[Bridge: Nick &amp; 
All
]
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
 (Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say
 (Oh, yeah)
I want it that way
[Chorus: Brian, 
All
, (Nick) &amp; 
AJ
]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
 (Don't want to hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
 
never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
[Outro: AJ]
'Cause I want it that way
