you love be so strong 
it crack at the slightest touch 
you love be so strong 
like nothing it crumble to dust to dust 
you love be so strong 
and it break and in pain 
you love be so strong 
like nothing it melt in the rain 
you love be so wide 
black on every tide every side 
you love be strong 
it shatter at the slightest hum 
you love be so strong 
like nothing it melt in the sun in the sun 
you love be so strong 
it be only a fear in you eye 
you love be so strong 
it be only a series of lie 
my love be so lose I will sell at any cost 
you love be the seed 
it be the promise I need to be deceive 
I need to be deceive to be deceive 
you be all that I need 
I will love you so long 
you love be so strong
