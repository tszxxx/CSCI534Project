[Verse 1]
Till the morning comes
It'll do you fine
Till the morning comes
Like a highway sign
Showing you the way
Leaving no doubt
Of the way on in
Or the way back out
[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
[Verse 2]
Till we all fall down
It'll do you fine
Don't think about
What you left behind
The way you came
Or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark
And snow
[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
[Verse 3]
When the shadows grow
It'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow
It'll ease your mind
The shape it takes
Could be yours to choose
What you may win
What you may lose
[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
[Outro]
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
