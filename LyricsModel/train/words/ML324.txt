I have feel the thunder speak of you name 
and I have watch the lightning you glory proclaim 
I have gaze upon mountain that testify of you fame 
and I have hear the wafe on the ocean echo they refrain 
this be my song my song to the King 
and I stand in awe of you majesty 
and I do not have much but I give everything 
this be my song song to my king 
it seem all creation oh it be long for you 
from here to the farthest star they be worship you 
and who be I God that you be mindful of I 
I be simple in heart simple in song I be a small offering 
but this be my song my song to the King 
and I stand in awe of you majesty 
and I do not have much but I give everything 
for this be my song my song to the King 
it be all the creation hesitate now 
and all of the angel stop sing now 
as the king of all glory listen to my song 
this be my song my song to my king 
and I stand in awe of you majesty 
and I do not have much but I give everything 
for this be my song song to my king 
be my song to my king 
my song to my king
