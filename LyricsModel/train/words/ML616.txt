all those crazy night when I cry myself to sleep now melodrama never make I weep anymore ' cause I have not get time for the pain I have not get room for the pain I have not the need for the pain not since I have know you you show I how , how to leave myself behind how to turn down the noise in my mind now I have not get time for the pain I have not get room for the pain I have not the need for the pain not since I have know you suffer be the only thing that make I feel I be alive though that 's just how much it cost to survive in this world ' Til you show I how , how to fill my heart with love how to open up and drink in all that white love pour down from the heaven I have not get time for the pain I have not get room for the pain I have not the need for the pain not since I have know you
