Fire on the bayou 
Fire on the bayou 
Fire on the bayou 
down in New Orleans in Lucky 's din 
he would not deal y'all for a 5th of gin 
one dude want a bottle of wine 
hit that dude yes he do up for a dollar and a dime 
Fire on the bayou 
Fire on the bayou 
take a little toke on you smoke 
buy yourself a bottle of wine 
cool cool wine go down you throat 
do not try and tell I do not make you feel fine 
Fire on the bayou 
Fire on the bayou 
I get a nickel now you get a dime 
let 's get together and have a good time 
goin to buy a fifth go to buy a joint 
when you gettin down now you doin thing right 
I get swamp water runnin through my vein 
the Mississippi River can not be tame 
I pole my pirogue in the middle of the night 
I be a uptown ruler I can do it right
