[Verse 1]
When the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging around
[Refrain]
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
[Verse 2]
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be's
[Refrain]
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
[Bridge]
Listen to the blues that they're playing
Listen to what the blues are saying
[Verse 3]
Life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
[Refrain]
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
