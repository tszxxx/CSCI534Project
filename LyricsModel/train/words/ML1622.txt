baby when i think about you 
I think about love 
darling do not live without you 
and you love 
if i have these golden dream 
of my yesterday 
I would wrap you in heaven 
till i be die on the way 
feel like makin love 
feel like make love to you 
baby if i think about you 
I think about love 
Darlin if i live without you 
I live without love 
if i have the sun and the moon 
I would give you both night and day 
of satisfying 
feel like make 
feel like makin love 
feel like make love to you 
and if i have those golden dream 
of my yesterday 
I would wrap you in heaven 
till i be dyin on the way 
feel like make love 
feel like make love to you
