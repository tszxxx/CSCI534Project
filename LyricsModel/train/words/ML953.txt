I be float in the blimp a lot 
I feel the feeling i forget 
of swim weightless in the womb 
or bounce gently round the room 
in a minute i will be free 
and you will be splash in the sea 
I feel no curiosity 
I see the path ahead of I 
in a minute i will be free 
and you will be splash in the sea 
we will hear a tiny cry 
as the ship go slide by
