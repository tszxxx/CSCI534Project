[Pre-Chorus]
When I woke up tonight I said I’m
Going to make somebody love me
I’m going to make somebody love me
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know
I know that it’s you
You’re lucky lucky you’re so lucky
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Want to go where I’d never let you before
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Want a go of what I’d never let you before
Well he’s a friend and he’s so proud of you
He’s a friend and I knew him before you
He’s a friend and we’re so proud of you
Your famous friend and I blew him before you
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Want to go where I’d never let you before
Here we are at the Transmission party
I love your friends – they’re all so arty, oh yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
When I woke up tonight I said I’m
Going to make somebody love me
I’m going to make somebody love me
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know
I know that it’s you
You’re lucky lucky you’re so lucky
[Chorus]
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Well do you
Do you
Do you want to
Want a go of what I’d never let you before
