[Verse 1]
I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of getting away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico
[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!
No problems
[Verse 2]
Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code
[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!
[Outro]
Babe let's get packed tank tops and flip flops if you got them
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems
