[Verse 1]
You are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love, to bring me love
[Verse 2]
Her eyes
She's on the dark side
Neutralize every man in sight, every man in sight
[Chorus]
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
[Verse 1]
You are my angel
Come from way above
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
[Instrumental]
