White demon love song down the hall White demon shadow on the road back up you mind , there be a call he be not come after all love this time she like the way he sing White demon love song 's in she dream White demon , where 's you selfish kiss ? White demon sorrow will arrange let 's not forget about the fear Black invitation to a place that can not change while strangely holy , come for a rain White demon , widen you heart 's scope White demon , who let you friend go ? White demon , widen you heart 's scope White demon , who let you friend go ? let we be in love let 's do old and grey I will not make you cry I will never stray I will do my part let we be in love tonight
