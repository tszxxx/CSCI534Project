I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love 
do you feel like you ever want 
to try my love and see how well it fit 
baby can not you see when you look at I 
I can not kick this feeling when it hit 
all alone in my bed at night 
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight 
I think of you and I dream of you 
all of the time what be I go to do 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love 
sometime do not you feel like you 
never really have a love that be real 
well here I be and who be to say 
a better love you will not find today 
just one chance and I will show you love 
like no other two step above 
on you ladder I will be a peg 
I want you loving please do not make I beg 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I need you love 
I will share my dream and make you see 
how really bad you love I need 
I want you love I need you love 
just like the bird need sky above 
I will share my dream and make you see 
how really bad you love I need 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love 
I want you love I want you love
