be you there when they crucify my Lord 
oh be you there when they crucify my Lord 
tremble 
be you there when they crucify my Lord 
be you there when they nail he to the cross 
be you there when they nail he to the cross 
tremble 
be you there when they nail he to the cross 
be you there when they lay he in the tomb 
be you there when they lay he in the tomb 
tremble 
be you there when they lay he in the tomb 
well be you there when the stone be roll away 
be you there when the stone be roll away 
tremble 
be you there when the stone be roll away
