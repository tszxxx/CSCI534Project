stand at the crossroad try to read the sign 
to tell I which way I should go to find the answer 
and all the time I know 
Plant you love and let it grow 
let it grow let it grow 
let it blossom let it flow 
in the sun the rain the snow 
love be lovely let it grow 
look for a reason to check out of my mind 
try hard to get a friend that I can count on 
but there be nothing leave to show 
Plant you love and let it grow 
time be get shorter and there be much for you to do 
only ask and you will get what you be need 
the rest be up to you 
Plant you love and let it grow
