tonight we sail the wide low wind 
Rolling she homeward 
with blood on we knife 
who would have know you be a deviant sister 
gut on you blouse 
you be worth you own weight 
in diamond a dozen 
sail to nowhere 
Vapor to float on 
still we roll on through the night 
tattle system trading in lie 
take down by the hound one by one 
long to find we way out 
follow the ghost down 
run in circle a mouse on the table 
I try to feel but just do not 
curling and dead inside 
go on and cut he in half say I
