so many day since you go away 
I often think of you night and day 
but I know that someday someday darling 
I will not be trouble no more 
trouble trouble and misery 
be about to get the best of I 
but I know that someday oh someday darling 
I will not be trouble no more 
I tell you my story I sang my song 
about you leave baby you know that be wrong 
but oh someday someday darling 
I will not be trouble no more
