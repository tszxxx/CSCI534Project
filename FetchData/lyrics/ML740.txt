[Verse 1]
The time has come for us to stop messin' around
Cause don't you know that I like havin' you around
...In my life, oh, baby
So many times I want to hold you, oh, so near
I want to say I love you
Softly in your ear
...Oh, baby, don't keep running
[Refrain]
My heart is yearning for your love
Cause my heart is yearning for your love
[Verse 2]
You can't keep runnin' in and out
Of my life
I need to have you as my lover and my wife
...Oh, baby, be my lover
So many times I need to have you by my side
To be my friend, my lover and my guide
...Oh, baby, don't keep runnin'
[Refrain]
My heart is yearning for your love
My heart is yearning for your love
My heart is yearning for you
Let me inside your love
Whoa, my heart is yearning for you
Let me inside your love, your love, your love
Your love
