I ain’t no more to try
And you don’t care I say
I never friggin’ try
I’ll never f*ck this time
[Chorus]
That I don’t want more
And you just try
Yeah I don’t want more
It’s no fun
It’s no fun
It’s no fun
It’s no fun
I should a known this time its
I think you know my path
I know what its like
That its worth a piece of trash
[Chorus]
