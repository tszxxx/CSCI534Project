every time I see you walk down the street with my girl I get a funny feeling when I see you out with my girl I get so lonely I get so lonely without you I get lonely for you see you everyday and now I realize you be not mine I know I just can not think of anything to do with my time ' cause I be so lonely I get so lonely without you wait oh how I be wait wait for you loving to keep I satisfied forever to keep I satisfied forever if you get tired of lovin ' he come right on back to my arm and then we will start anew and know that we never will part ' cause I be so lonely I get so lonely without you I get lonely for you
