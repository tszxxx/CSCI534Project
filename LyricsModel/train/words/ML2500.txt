I tell you what the reason

rap PATO BANTON 
it be time to stop and think about 
what you do to other 
and if it be good we will go ahead 
and JAH will sure protect you 
but if it be bad just watch you step 
cause you will surely stumble 
remember who inherit the land 
the meek and very humble 
my generation 
God help the child 
my generation 
God help the child 
DAVID
