Robbie Seay Band 
miscellaneous 
song of hope 
you be my greatest friend 
you be my deepest need 
you be my loudest cry 
you be my everything 
you be my only hope 
you be my forgiveness 
you be my every breath 
you be my comfort here 
you be my everything 
you be my only hope 
the maker of the earth 
the giver of my life 
the healer of my heart 
Forgiver of my soul 
you be my only hope
