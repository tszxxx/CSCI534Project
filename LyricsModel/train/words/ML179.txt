somewhere over the rainbow way up high 
there be a land that I have hear of once in a lullaby 
somewhere over the rainbow sky be blue 
and the dream that you dare to dream really do come true 
someday I will wish upon a star and wake up when the cloud be far 
behind I 
where trouble melt like lemon drop away above the chimney top 
that be where you will find I 
somewhere over the rainbow blue bird fly 
bird fly over the rainbow why then oh why can not I 
if happy little blue bird fly across the rainbow 
why oh why can not I
