this be my appeal 
to all you leader out there to stop the war 
cuz there be no justifiable reason 
it be about time that you realize that you not fulfil you true purpose 
this one be for the leader who be fight war 
all over the world 
this one be for the leader who be fight war 
all over the world 
think about the yute who be do out 
cry out for love 
victim of the system we divide and grow 
to break we down and tear we apart 
what be the future of the human race 
how will the child grow to take we place 
where be the love that we should all embrace 
I do believe it be here for you and I 
this one be for the leader who be fight war 
all over the world 
imagine all the money that you spend on arm 
gun and bomb to destroy 
while people be leave hungry to die from want 
and those who do survive be unemployed 
what be the future of the human race 
how will the child grow to take we place 
where be the love that we should all embrace 
I do believe it here for you and I
