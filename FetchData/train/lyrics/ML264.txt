I don't know, I don't know
Where I'll go or what I'll do
It makes no difference
What I'll do without you
Oh, I love you, my darling
But I'll try and let you be
Goodbye, it's the last
You'll hear of me
Well, I found a bluebird
High on a mountain side
And the little bird
Would sing its little song
So I'll sigh, I'll cry
I'd even wanna die
For the one I love is gone
Well, I found a bluebird
High on a mountain side
And the little bird
Would sing its little song
So I'll sigh, I'll cry
I'd even wanna die
For the one that I love has gone
