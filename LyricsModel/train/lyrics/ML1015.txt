[Verse 1: Al Green]
Whoa, you're beautiful to me
More than my eyes can see
Your hair blowin' in the wind
I don't know why love should end
[Pre-Chorus: Al Green]
Stardust in the sky
I either love you or die
I've gotta have you in my life
I really wanna make you my wife, ooh
[Chorus: Al Green &amp; Anthony Hamilton]
You got the love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
Oh, my only friend
The only truth I know
Oh, you taught me things about me
I never thought I'd know
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Darlin', you been there for me, yeah
Through the strangest of the time
Oh, it must be meant to be
My kind of little love for mine
[Chorus: Al Green &amp; Anthony Hamilton]
You got the love I need, baby
(I tell you, baby, you got it)
You got the love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
(Everything I need, you got it)
You got the love I need, baby
[Pre-Chorus: Al Green &amp; (Anthony Hamilton)]
Stardust blowin' in the wind (Blowin' in the wind)
I don't know why love should end
I like lovin' you, so (I like lovin' you)
I'll never, never, never let you go
[Chorus: Al Green &amp; Anthony Hamilton]
You got the love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
(Hug and hold me tight, baby)
You got the love I need, baby
(You give me everything I need)
You got the love I need, baby
(One more time, baby, you got)
You got the love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
You got love I need, baby
You got the love I need, baby
