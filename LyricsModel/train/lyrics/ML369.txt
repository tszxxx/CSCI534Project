[Verse 1]
Said you'd always feel like
Then everything just changed in the blink of an eye
And I could never leave like
There was anything left to leave behind
[Pre-Chorus]
You were right there, and I was lonely
And I could let you down
[Chorus]
Someday you'll say
There's always been a part of me
Feeling like my heart is so far away
Searching for a part of me
Looking for somebody to blame
[Verse 2]
Said you'd always be around
Then you leave it all out on the line
I'd tear it all down
Just to watch you change what you know was right
[Pre-Chorus]
You were right there, and I was lonely
And I could let you down
[Chorus]
Someday you'll say
There's always been a part of me
Feeling like my heart is so far away
Searching for a part of me
Looking for somebody to blame
[Bridge]
I need you to hear
Everything I wanted to say
[Chorus]
Someday you'll say
There's always been a part of me
Feeling like my heart is so far away
Searching for a part of me
Looking for somebody to blame
[Outro]
Somebody to blame
Searching for a part of me
Looking for somebody to blame
