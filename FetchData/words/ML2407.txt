I ´m tired of lickin´ they boot that be - a-kickin´ I ! Sick of they sour grape they keep - a pickin´ I ! set loose you wing , cut the string of you puppeteer freedom begin , baby , between you ear Reach for the sky you do not have to buy what they be advertisin´ not when you be mile high and risin ! open my eye to the lie that ´d be a-trickin´ I ! cut all the horn , pull the thorn that ´d be - stickin´ I ! Chorus if you get the feelin´ what they be dealin´ get you livin´ under way too low a ceiling ... cut through you doom and you gloom C´mon and grab yourself some headroom Chorus
