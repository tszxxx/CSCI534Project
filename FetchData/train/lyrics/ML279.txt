[Intro]
I don't know how to explain it
But I know the words would hardly do
Miracles and signs and wonders
Aren't enough for me to prove to you
[Chorus 1]
Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
"Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will"
[Verse 1]
Greater love has not a man
Than the one who gives his life to prove
That he would do anything
And that's what I'm gonna do for you
[Chorus 2]
Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
"Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will"
[Chorus 3]
Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
"Don't you know I've always loved you"
[Chorus 4]
Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
"Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will"
[Outro]
I've always loved you, oh
And I always will
I've always loved you
And I always will
I've always loved you, oh
And I always, and I always will
I've always loved you...
