Bo Diddley buy he babe a diamond ring 
if that diamond ring do not shine 
he go to take it to a private eye 
if that private eye can not see 
he would better not take the ring from I 
Bo Diddley catch a nanny goat 
to make he pretty baby a Sunday coat 
Bo Diddley catch a bearcat 
to make he pretty baby a Sunday hat 
Mojo come to my house you black cat bone 
take my baby away from home 
ugly ole mojo where you bin 
up you house and go again 
Bo Diddley Bo Diddley have you hear 
my pretty baby say she be not for it
