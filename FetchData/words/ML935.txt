if I could only relive yesterday I think I would try to do it right if I have one more chance to be with you I think it just might save my life Chorus : just one more chance and I will be you love forever one more chance , one more chance just one more chance and I will be you love forever one more chance , one more chance I be catch it the same old world and I just can not get my head unwhirled and I be look for any old place to hide I take a journey down through paradise I think I would like to make it twice I take another journey yesterday I hope it just will not ruin my life Chorus : just one more chance and I will be you love forever one more chance , one more chance just one more chance and I will be you love forever one more chance , one more chance
