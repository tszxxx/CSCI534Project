comb you hair I know nothing about you 
smil like a young moon 
look in the mirror 
my card know you could be happy like a child 
raise you arm to I 
wait to be come down to I 
in you love I swear 
in you love I hide 
in you love I sleep 
in you love I turn 
in you love I cry 
in my life I ride 
I ask you again 
try so hard so that I could sleep without you 
and you you keep hold on to my lonely part 
in you love I swear 
in you love I hide 
in you love I sleep 
in you love I turn 
in you love I cry 
in my life I ride 
I ask you again 
be this love or prison 
be this love or prison 
this be love 
be this love or prison 
be this love or prison 
this be love 
be this love or prison 
this be love 
be this love or prison 
this be love 
be this love or prison 
this be love
