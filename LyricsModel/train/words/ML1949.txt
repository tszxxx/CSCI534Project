happy talk keep talkin happy talk 
talk about thing you would like to do 
you get to have a dream if you do not have a dream 
how you go to have a dream come true 
talk about the moon floatin in the sky 
lookin at a lily on the lake 
talk about a bird learnin how to fly 
makin all the music he can make 
happy talk keep talkin happy talk 
talk about thing you would like to do 
you get to have a dream if you do not have a dream 
how you go to have a dream come true 
talk about a boy sayin to a girl 
golly baby I be a lucky cause 
talk about the girl sayin to the boy 
you and I be lucky to be we 
happy talk keep talkin happy talk 
talk about thing you would like to do 
you get to have a dream if you do not have a dream 
how you go to have a dream come true 
if you do not talk happy and you never have dream 
then you will never have a dream come true
