[Intro]
Kill all!
Fight death!
Lesions
Fighting love
[Verse 1]
Fight them all in a living hell
Slowly rot and you die
You fight death as you
Slowly realize
Kill them all, fight death
And slowly read in the love
Fight them all, join me
Slowly we rot
Slowly we rot!
[Verse 2]
Dead to all, fighting as you
Slowly read in your love
Fighting the sword
The sword is your plow
Dead to all, fighting as you're
Slowly rotting in hell
Fight them all, join me
Slowly we dwell
Slowly we dwell!
[Bridge]
Decharge!
[Outro]
Rot!
