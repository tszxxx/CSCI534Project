a country dance be be hold in a garden I feel a bump and hear a " oh , beg you pardon " suddenly I see polka dot and moonbeam all around a pug-nose dream the music start and be I the perplex one I hold my breath and say , " May I have the next one ? " in my frighten arm , polka dot and moonbeam Sparkled on a pug-nose dream there be question in the eye of other dancer as we float over the floor there be question , but my heart know all the answer and perhaps a few thing more now in a cottage build of lilac and laughter I know the mean of the word " ever after " and I will always see polka dot and moonbeam when I kiss the pug-nose dream
