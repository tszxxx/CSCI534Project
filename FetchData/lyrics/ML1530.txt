You've been out of my life sometime now
Seem like a long, long while
Sometimes the thoughts of you
Bring tears to my eyes
While the times that bring a smile
I remember what you told me
We would always be close in our hearts
Must be easy to sleep in another man's arms
We're so damn far apart
On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night
There's a picture of you hanging on my wall
Such a lovely girl
Sometimes I feel like breaking into pieces
Like you did to my world
Oh, and other times I wanna hold her in my arms
Like a ball in chain
I look till I'm through loving you
I can never love again
On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
On a real lonely night
Just no way to pass the time
I walk around and I talk to myself
Pretending that it's you
I can almost see your face
I can't hold you
Like we used to do
On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
And feel your warm breath on my skin
Just making me a fool
On a real lonely night
Just no way to pass the time
I walk around and I talk to myself
Pretending that it's you, yes, I do
I can almost see your face
I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night
On a real lonely night
On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
