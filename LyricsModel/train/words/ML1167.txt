at first flash of Eden 
we race down to the sea 
stand there on freedom 's shore 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
can not you feel it 
now that spring have come 
that it be time to live in the scatter sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
wait wait wait wait 
wait wait wait wait 
wait for you to come along 
wait for you to hear my song 
wait for you to come along 
wait for you to tell I what go wrong 
this be the strangest life I have ever know and 
can not you feel it 
now that spring have come 
that it be time to live in the scatter sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun 
wait for the sun
