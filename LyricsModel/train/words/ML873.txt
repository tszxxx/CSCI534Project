ooh you be give I the fever tonight 
I do not want to give in I would be play with fire 
you forget I have see you work before 
take them straight to the top leave them cry for more 
I have see you burn them before 
Fire and ice 
you come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder 
Fire and ice 
I want to give you my love but you will just take a little piece of my heart 
you will just tear it apart 
move in for the kill tonight 
you get every advantage when they put out the light 
it be not so pretty when it fade away 
cause it be just a illusion in this passion play 
I have see you burn them before 
Fire and ice 
you come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder 
Fire and ice 
I want to give you my love but you will just take a little piece of my heart 
so you think you get it all figure out 
you be a expert in the field without a doubt 
but I know you method inside and out 
and I will not be take in by fire and ice 
Fire and ice 
you come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder 
Fire and ice 
I want to give you my love but you will just take a little piece of my heart 
you come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder 
Fire and ice 
I want to give you my love but you will just take a little piece of my heart 
you come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder 
Fire and ice 
you come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder 
Fire and ice
