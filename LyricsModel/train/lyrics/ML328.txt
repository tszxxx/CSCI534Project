[Verse 1]
We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord
We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord
And we pray that our unity may one day be restored
And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love
Yeah, they'll know we are Christians by our love
[Verse 2]
We will work with each other, we will work side by side
We will work with each other, we will work side by side
And we'll guard each man's dignity and save each man's pride
And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love
Yeah, they'll know we are Christians by our love
[Outro]
Our love
By our love
Our love, by our love
Our love, by our love
By love, by our love
By our, by our love
By love, by our love
Love, our love
Love
