[Verse 1]
Well, I opened up the bottle and I fell out of bed
I couldn't find the floor until it hit me in the head
I did a little powder off the bathroom sink
It's been about a month and something's start to stink
Me and the band, we are starting to fight
Because if we got along it just wouldn't feel right
[Pre-Chorus]
We're the white trash circus, don't give a damn
We'll steal your girl whenever we can
We're the drunken god's of the living dead
[Chorus]
We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head
We're the trash, we're the trash
We're the trash in your bed
[Verse 2]
I been living on the road about a year and half
If we go another mile, we're going to kick each other's ass
Someone's going to quit or someone's going to die
We don't give a shit because we're busy getting high
Another lawsuit, another arrest
We wouldn't change a thing because we love it to death
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
We're the son's of devil, we're the blood on the stage
You can love us, you can hate us but we'll never go away
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus][x2]
We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head
We're the trash, we're the trash
We're the trash in your bed
