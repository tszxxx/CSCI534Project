[Intro]
I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
[Verse]
Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
[Pre-Chorus]
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love
What would life be?
[Chorus]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love
What would life be?
[Chorus]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
