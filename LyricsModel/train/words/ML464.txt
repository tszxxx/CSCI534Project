so she say what be the problem baby 
what be the problem I do not know 
well maybe I be in love 
think about it every time I think about it 
can not stop think bout it 
how much longer will it take to cure this 
just to cure it cause I can not ignore it if it be love 
make I want to turn around and face I 
but I do not know nothing 's bout love no 
come on come on 
turn a little faster 
come on come on 
the world will follow after 
come on come on 
because everybody 's after love 
so I say I be a snowball running 
run down into the spring that be come all this love 
melt under blue sky 
belt out sunlight 
shimmere love 
well baby I surrender 
to the 
strawberry ice cream 
never ever end of all this love 
well I do not mean to do it 
but there be no escape you love oh 
these line of lightning 
mean we be never alone 
never alone no no 
come on come on 
move a little closer 
come on come on 
I want to hear you whisper 
come on come on 
settle down inside my love 
come on come on 
jump a little higher 
come on come on 
if you feel a little lighter 
come on come on 
we be once upon a time in love 
we be accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally in love 
accidentally 
I be in love I be in love 
I be in love I be in love 
I be in love I be in love 
accidentally 
I be in love I be in love 
I be in love I be in love 
I be in love I be in love 
accidentally 
come on come on 
spin a little tighter 
come on come on 
and the world be a little brighter 
come on come on 
just get yourself inside she love 
I be in love
