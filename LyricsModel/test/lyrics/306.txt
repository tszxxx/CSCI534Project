Truer than the Red, White and Blue

That's me and you
And on a star spangled night my love

Free'r than the land of the free
Love, American Style
That's you and me
We pledge our love 'neath the same old moon
(But it shines) But it shines red and white and blue now
Upon this land of hopes and dreams, my love
(All that I hope) Where all I hope for tis of thee
(All I hope for 'tis of) Love, American Style
Truer than the Red, White and Blue
Love, American Style
That's me and you
And in this land of hopes and dreams, my love
All that I hope for 'tis of thee
Love, Love, Love

Free'r than the land of the free
Love, American Style
Truer than the Red, White and Blue
