And when I'm not
I'm cold as ice
See me comin'
Step aside
Or pay the price
What I want I take
What I don't I break
And I don't want you
With a flick of my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do
Cause I'm a problem child
Make my stand
No man's land
On my own
Man in blue
It's up to you
The seed is sown
What I want I stash
What I don't I smash
N' you're on my list
Dead or alive
Got a .45
N' I never miss
Cause I'm a problem child
Every night
Street light
I drink my booze
Some run
Some fight
I win they lose
What I need I like
What I don't I fight
N' I don't like you
So say bye bye
While your still alive
Cause your time is due
Cause I'm a problem child
