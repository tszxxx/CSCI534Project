now this could only happen to a guy like I 
and only happen in a town like this 
so may I say to each of you most gratefully 
as I throw each one of you a kiss this be 
my kind of town Chicago be 
my kind of town Chicago be 
my kind of people too 
people who smile at you 
and each time I roam Chicago be 
call I home Chicago be 
why I just grin like a clown 
it be my kind of town 
my kind of town Chicago be 
my kind of town Chicago be 
my kind of razzmatazz 
and it have all that jazz 
and each time I leave Chicago be 
Tuggin my sleeve Chicago be 
the Wrigley Building Chicago be 
the Union Stockyard Chicago be 
one town that will not let you dow and 
it be my kind of town
