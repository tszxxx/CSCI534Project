I wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
And I expect that might be the whole world
Because everybody needs something or someone to love
When it's cold outside who are you holding
You know
If y'all don't mind I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
She's always complaining 'bout me never being at home
But when I'm there I'm broke
She's telling me 'bout the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got, and she wants me to go out and get em for her
But, but girl, I can't be in two places at one time
If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl
I'll be long gone
And you'll find another man that'll treat you right
When I ain't there to rub your back
Just remember I made it a known fact
And the skeletons come out of the closet
And chase you all around your room
And the memories sail round like a ghost
And dance around in a sad slow tune, ah
If you think you're lonely now
Oh, wait until tonight
I'll be long gone
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right
If you think you're lonely now
Wai-ait, wait until tonight, girl
Oh, ain't it funny how the tables turn
When things aren't going your where
But when love runs out, and the pain walks in
And settles for a stay, ooh
Lord, help me, I feel like I wanna testify
Girl, wait until tonight
If you think you're lonely, lonely, lonely now
Oh, you just wait until tonight, girl
You see tonight's the night when the needs come out
When your needs come out to breathe
And you toast the stars and there ain't now way you can sleep, oh
If you think you're lonely now
I feel like I wanna testify this evening
I'm lonely, cause I know I gotta leave you, oh, girl
I just can't take no more
Ooh...hoo...hoo...
Ah, girl, you just wait
If you think you got problems now, baby, you just wait
Wait
Too far gone, I'm packing up now
Ooh...hoo...ooh...hoo, babe
You say you're a little lonely
But everybody needs somebody to love
It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side
That'll build you up when you're falling down
And you had that someone, baby
Cause I've done my time
And it's your turn now
If you think you're lonely now
Wait, wait until tonight
I'm tired
I'm tired of the same old shuck and jive
It's been too long
If you think we could start all over again
It's been too long
If you think we could start just one more time
