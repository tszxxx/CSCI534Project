wait in the club lounge 
I slot in so systematically 
I want to smash it to piece 
release this hatred inside of I 
you know you fill I with passion 
but I just act apologetically 
I be go to miss you in fashion 
all ashen face with my deceit 
São Paulo 
why be I bring I down 
São Paulo 
if I drink any more I will drow 
São Paulo 
why can not I fight truth decay 
São Paulo 
my life be just one big cliche 
another stain on my passport 
I want to travel so futuristically 
I just wish I could beam up team up 
and soon be on my way 
you tell I we would go to Rio 
and you say it so charismatically 
I know it be I that be the nightmare 
so fight fair or have some decency 
São Paulo 
why be I bring I down 
São Paulo 
if I drink any more I will drow 
São Paulo 
why can not I fight truth decay 
São Paulo 
my life be just one big cliche 
São Paulo 
why be I bring I down 
São Paulo 
if I drink any more I will drow 
São Paulo 
why can not I fight truth decay 
São Paulo 
my life be just one big cliche 
you sure put a spin on my day 
why be I head you way 
everything be come up grey 
I be just a humble dj
