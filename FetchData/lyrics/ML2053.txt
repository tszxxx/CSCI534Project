[Intro]
I'll have a blue blue Christmas
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
[Chorus]
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurting
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Outro]
A blue blue Christmas without you
