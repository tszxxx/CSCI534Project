shadow of doubt consume you 
the light you barely see 
Grow wing of sorrow 
have bring you to the wind of plague 
increscent boundary fade the way 
a barren future all too real 
and still I try to seek up and find the flame 
and still I try inside 
it be endless 
a barren future all too real 
and still I try 
endless fight 
endless tragedy 
endless lunacy 
chalk up the past as a memory 
this battering sickness have surely will and 
all I have I have waste 
will this erase I 
time to clean my wound 
can I win this battle inside and out 
can I win this battle inside out 
endless fight 
endless tragedy 
endless lunacy
