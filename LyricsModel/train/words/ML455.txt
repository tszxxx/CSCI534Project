would you love I 
when night be cold 
would you love I 
when I grow old 
would you care 
when live be not easy 
take I by surprise 
and say you be there 
would you love I 
give I one more chance 
would you love I 
try and understand 
would you share 
a life that be music 
show I in you eye 
that you will stay with I tonight 
I can not live without you 
all my dream around you 
I be lose in love 
and it be true 
I can not live without you 
oh no 
would you love I 
when I be in doubt 
would you love I 
just to be around 
would you share 
my life that be music 
take I in you arm 
and sing my melody 
I can not live without you 
all my dream around you 
and I be lose in love 
and it be true 
I can not live without you 
oh no 
say you really want I 
love be a passion 
it just can not hide 
time and again and it hurt I 
you will be my reason 
for start again 
I can not live without you 
and all my dream around you 
I can not live without you 
baby baby baby baby 
baby I can not live without you
