on we way from Stockholm 
start to snow 
and you say it be like Christmas 
but you be wrong 
it be not like Christmas at all 
by the time we get to Oslo 
Snow be go 
and we get lose 
the bed be small 
but we feel so young 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas 
it be just like Christmas
