meeting you with a view to a kill 
face to face in secret place feel the chill 
Nightfall cover I but you know the plan I be make 
still overseas could it be the whole Earth opening wide 
a sacred why a mystery gape inside 
a week be why until we 
dance into the fire 
that fatal kiss be all we need 
dance into the fire 
to fatal sound of broken dream 
dance into the fire 
that fatal kiss be all we need 
dance into the fire 
the choice for you be the view to a kill 
between the shade assassination stand still 
Earth 's crystal tear the fall of snowflake on you body 
first time in year to drench you skin in lover 's rosy stain 
a chance to find the phoenix for the flame 
a chance to die but can we 
dance into the fire 
that fatal kiss be all we need 
dance into the fire 
to fatal sound of broken dream 
dance into the fire 
that fatal kiss be all we need 
dance into the fire 
when all we see be the view to a kill
