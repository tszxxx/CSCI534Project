in my solitude you haunt I 
with revery of day go by 
in my solitude you taunt I 
with memory that never die 
I sit in my chair 
fill with despair 
nobody could be so sad 
with gloom ev'rywhere 
I sit and I stare 
I know that I will soon go mad 
in my solitude 
I be pray 
dear Lord above 
send back my love 
I sit in my chair 
I be fill with despair 
there be no one could be so sad 
with gloom ev'rywhere 
I sit and I stare 
I know that I will soon go mad 
in my solitude 
I be pray 
dear Lord above 
send back my love
