[Verse 1]
Well I've been judged,
 
I've been a bug unknown
Yeah I know all about it but my heart is strong
I've been away, been running to save my head
Yeah the warrant's out and I'm almost dead
I won't say what I've already said
[Chorus]
Got to get away, yeah the warrants on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah the warrants on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
[Verse 2]
I've thought a lot about the way that they fight
Come through the phone lines
Not man enough to face me
I can't stop or argue about what they say
Yeah the warrant's out
And I'm not gonna pay
I said what I'm gonna say
[Chorus]
Got to get away, yeah the warrants on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah the warrants on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
[Verse 3]
Fear is like a fake friend
It warms you up and takes you in
You mouth the words but no sound comes out
Fear is like your best friend
Manipulates and takes you in
You mouth the words no sound again
But you don't know better, you don't know better
[Chorus]
Got to get away, yeah the warrants on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah the warrants on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
