why why be you still here with I 
do not you see what I have do 
in my shame I want to run and hide myself 
but it be here I see the truth 
I do not deserve you 
but I need you to love I and I 
I will not keep my heart from you this time 
and I will stop this pretend that I can and 
somehow deserve what I already have 
I need you to love I 
I I have waste so much time 
push you away from I 
I just never see how you could cherish I 
cause you be a God who have all thing 
and still you want I 
and I need you to love I and I 
I will not keep my heart from you this time 
and I will stop this pretend that I can and 
somehow deserve what I already have 
you love make I forget what I have be 
you love make I see who I really be 
you love make I forget what I have be 
I need you to love I 
I need you to love I 
I need you to love I 
and I will stop this pretend that I can and 
somehow deserve what I already have 
somehow deserve what I already have 
I need you to love I 
I need you to
