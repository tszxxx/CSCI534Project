Trash, go pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, don't take your life away
Trash, go pick it up, the doctor take my knife away
And please don't you ask me if I love you
If you don't know what I'm doing
What you know is
Trash, go pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, don't throw your love away
Trash, go pick it up, the doctor take my knife away
And please don't you ask me if I love you
'Cause I don't know what I do
What I know is
Trash, pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, don't take my knife away
Trash, go pick it up, the doctor take them all away
And please don't you ask me if I love you
'Cause I don't know if I do
I want to wipe it out here with you
And take a lover's leap with you
I'm gonna talk alone with you
I'm gonna talk and be with you
But I just don't know if I do
I just don't know if I do
Ah, how do you call your loverboy?
Trash, pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, go put that knife away
Trash, go pick it up, don't give your life away
Trash, pick it up, don't throw your love away
Trash, pick it up, don't take my knife away
Trash, pick it up, the doctor take them all away
Trash, pick it up, don't take my knife away
Oh, trash, wow, wow, my sweet baby, wow, wow
Oh, oh, trash, wow, wow, you're the one
Tttttttttrash
