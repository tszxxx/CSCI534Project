she sing from somewhere you can not see 
she sit in the top of the greenest tree 
she send out a aroma of undefined love 
it drip on down in a mist from above 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
you hear she call everywhere you turn 
you know you be head for the pleasure burn 
but the word get stuck on the tip of you tongue 
she be the real thing but you know it all along 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
look at you with you mouth water 
look at you with you mind spinning 
why do not we just admit it be all over 
she be just the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl just the girl 
the girl you want 
she sing from somewhere you can not see 
she sit in the top of the greenest tree 
she send out a aroma of undefined lust 
it drip on down in a mist from above 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
look at you with you mouth water 
look at you with you mind spinning 
why do not we just admit it be all over 
she be just the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl 
the girl you want 
she be just the girl she be just the girl
