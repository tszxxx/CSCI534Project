you have be out of my life sometime now seem like a long , long while sometimes the thought of you bring tear to my eye while the time that bring a smile I remember what you tell I we would always be close in we heart must be easy to sleep in another man 's arm we be so damn far apart on a real lonely night I can almost hear you laugh just make I a fool I can almost see you face on a real lonely night there 's a picture of you hang on my wall such a lovely girl sometimes I feel like break into piece like you do to my world oh , and other time I want to hold she in my arm like a ball in chain I look till I be through loving you I can never love again on a real lonely night I can almost hear you laugh just make I a fool on a real lonely night just no way to pass the time I walk around and I talk to myself pretend that it 's you I can almost see you face I can not hold you like we use to do on a real lonely night I can almost hear you laugh and feel you warm breath on my skin just make I a fool on a real lonely night just no way to pass the time I walk around and I talk to myself pretend that it 's you , yes , I do I can almost see you face I can almost see you face on a real lonely night on a real lonely night on a real lonely night I can almost hear you laugh
