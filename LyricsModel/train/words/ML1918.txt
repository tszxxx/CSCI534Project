some see life as a broken promise 
some see life as a endless fight 
they think they live in the age of darkness 
they think they live in the age of Light 
it be a angry world 
and everything be go to be all right 
yeah it be a angry world 
yeah it be a angry world 
some see life as hope eternal 
some see life as a business plan 
some will go to hell 's inferno 
for screw up they life in freedom land 
it be a angry world 
for the business man and the fisher man 
it be a angry world 
and no doubt everything will go as plan 
yeah it be a angry world 
yeah it be a angry world
