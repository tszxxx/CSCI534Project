this be the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz 
voice sound sad as they be sing along another piece of America 's lose 
he ride a feed lot and clerk in a market 
on weekend sell tobacco and beer 
he dream of tomorrow surround by fence 
but he will dream tonight of when fence be not here 
he blaze the trail with Lewis and Clark 
and eyeball to eyeball 
Ol Wyatt 
back down 
he stand shoulder to shoulder with 
Travis 
in Texas 
and ride with the seventh when 
Custer 
go down 
this be the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz 
voice sound sad as they be sing along another piece of America 's lose 
Remington show we how he look on canvas 
and 
Louis L'Amour 
have tell we he tale 
and 
Willie and Waylon 
and I sing about he 
and wish to God we could have ride he trail 
the 
old Chisholm trail 
be cover in concrete now 
and they truck them to market in fifty foot rigs 
they blow by he market never slow to reason 
like live and die be all he do 
this be the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz 
voice sound sad as they be sing along another piece of America 's lose 
this be the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz 
voice sound sad as they be sing along another piece of America 's lose 
this be the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz 
voice sound sad as they be sing along another piece of America 's lose
