Buzzing up with a musical attack
Rip it up with a boom sound we no lack
Got the rhythms the dub play killa tracks
Annihilate and destroy them we do that
Letting them know that ah we come for rock and control again
Ho ho well
Setting the pace in the place
Volume up driving them insane
Oh that's right-o
Turn your system down
(You know the weak can't take it)
Burn it to the ground
(Watch how we shatter and we break it)
(Pressure)
Stress it just drive them underground
(Pressure)
Cannot take the music kill the sound
(Pressure)
Yeah we turn it up but never down
(Pressure)
Stress it just drive them underground
(Pressure)
Cannot take the music kill the sound
(Pressure)
Yeah we turn it up but never down
Pressure
Pressure
Pressure
Annoying neighbours are banging on your door
Saying that they can't take your noise no more
Your bass is right in there face sounds murder raw
But ain't turning it off so call the law
Let them all know that
The rockers is hard and is here to stay
Ho ho well
Tell em to move from your step
And back off and just go away
Oh that's right-o
Turn your system down
(You know the weak can't take it)
Burn it to the ground
(Watch how we shatters and we break it)
(Pressure)
Stress it just drive them underground
(Pressure)
Cannot take the music kill the sound
(Pressure)
Yeah we turn it up but never down
(Pressure)
Stress it just drive them underground
(Pressure)
Cannot take the music kill the sound
(Pressure)
Yeah we turn it up but never down
