[Verse 1]
An endless love, I've found in You
Warm and inspiring, in everything you do
Two joined together, to give from within
To share a love as, intimate Friends
[Chorus]
Intimate Friends (so glad to be yours)
Intimate Friends (whoo-oo-oo-oo)
Intimate Friends (sharing hours)
Intimate Friends (and I want you to know)
Your love, takes me higher
My life, you inspire
Fill me with love and desire
Your love, takes me higher
[Verse 2]
Our love shines brighter, than the morning sun
Two hearts together becoming as one
You're a part of me - that never dies
Love undivided, cause we see eye to eye
Cause we're....
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
So glad to be yours
Intimate Friends
Intimate Friends
Yeah, you're so warm
Brighter than the morning son
You and I will become as one
Your love takes me higher, (higher), higher, (higher)
My life you inspire
[Outro]
Intimate Friends
Intimate Friends (oooh-oooh-oooh-oo-oooooh)
Intimate Friends (oooh-oooh-oooh-oo-oooooh)
Intimate Friends (oooh-oooh-oooh-oo-oooooh)
