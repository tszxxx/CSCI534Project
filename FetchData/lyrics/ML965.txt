[Verse 1]
People think when you don't understand
What it takes to wanna be a man
I don't care much for that
I don't know why
[Verse 2]
Justified or just a waste of time
Hiding things that no one wants to find
I don't know much of that
I don't care why
[Chorus] x2
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
[Verse 3]
When I was a kid I saw a light
Floating high above the trees one night
Thought it was an alien
Turned out to be just god
[Verse 4]
If you're not sure who not to believe
Who has better reasons to deceive?
They're really good at that
That's all they do
[Chorus] x2
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
[Outro]
And we won't share
No, we won't share
And we won't share
No, we won't share
