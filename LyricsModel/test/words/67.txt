I be a stranger in the city out of town be the people I know I have that feeling of self - pity what to do , what to do , what to do the outlook be decidedly blue but as I walk through the foggy street alone it turn out to be the luckiest day I have know n a foggy day , in London town have I low , have I down I view the morning , with much alarm british Museum , have lose its charm how long I wonder could this thing last but the age of miracle , have not pass for suddenly , I see you there and through foggy London town the sun be shine everywhere for suddenly , I see you there and through foggy London town the sun be shine everywhere everywhere everywhere everywhere
