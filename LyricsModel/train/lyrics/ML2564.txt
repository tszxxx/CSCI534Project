[Verse 1: Syreeta]
The strangest thought came to me on this morning
As I awoke to greet the coming dawn
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden
It felt that with everything I was one
[Chorus: Syreeta]
Then I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love
[Verse 2: Syreeta]
The dew had finished making love to many
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air
I envied all the silence I saw growing
So unmoved by things outside of themselves
[Chorus: Syreeta]
Then how I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
Oh, as a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love
