do not look back it will not do any good 
do not look ahead you will just be misunderstood 
everything you need could be right in front of you 
it do not take much to see what be true 
they say we be go to die if we go on like this 
who do you believe every story have a twist 
take a look around tell I what you see 
people in the world just try to be free 
what about all those thing you could have do but you do not 
they say thing happen for a reason you do not do they they will not 
I be look for life love and laughter 
everything in between and what happen after 
I be look for life lookin for love lookin for laughter 
thing be gunna change they never stay the same 
that be why we be fight a war but the people be to blame 
you can only stand up for what you believe 
do not be blind by the power of greed 
what about all those thing you could have do but you do not 
they say thing happen for a reason you do not do they they will not 
I be look for life love and laughter 
everything in between and what happen after 
I be look for life love and laughter 
everything in between and what happen after 
look for laughter 
we get everything we need 
all the money in the world want to buy what we see 
dream be worth more than gold 
some people hold on some people let go 
the star all come out at night 
the velvet sky all so bright 
I feel so close to you 
because I see what you see too 
I be look for life love and laughter 
everything in between and what happen after 
look for life 
I be look for life love and laughter 
everything in between and what happen after 
what happen after 
I be look for life love and laughter 
everything in between and what happen after 
what happen after
