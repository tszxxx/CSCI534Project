I hear these time be the end 
and another one must fall down 
I do not think I believe it 
when another one must fall down 
give we the distance 
and another one will fall down 
the sun in the open sky 
fall down fall down 
stare back into my own eye 
fall down fall down 
a stranger in my own skin 
fall down fall down 
one decade later 
and another one must fall down 
the earth be not hum 
I watch they all fall down 
fall into the sound in front of I 
unchange by those around 
directionless 
a open sea 
we will watch as time tumble down 
the sun in the open sky 
fall down fall down 
stare back into my own eye 
fall down fall down 
a stranger in my own skin 
fall down fall down 
fall down
