you be only 29 
get a lot to learn 
but when you mummy die 
she will not return 
we like noise it be we choice 
it be what we want to do 
we do not care about long hair 
I do not wear flare 
see my face not a trace 
no reality 
I do not work I just speed 
that be all I need 
I be a lazy sod I be lazy sod 
I be a lazy sod I be so lazy 
I be a lazy sod I be lazy sod 
I be a lazy sod I be so lazy 
I can not even be bother 
lazy lazy
