away 
I see it be go down today 
hope in time we will bury all this pain 
and will awake something inside 
we push we button far inside 
we tear we heart out then we fight 
hey I know 
feel like I have lose everything that I have know and 
I can not survive alone 
feel like I have lose everything that I have know and 
we life be good in every way 
too late time after time 
we love just turn to hate 
but we stay by each other 's side 
we push we button far inside 
we tear we heart out then we fight 
hey I know 
feel like I have lose everything that I have know and 
I can not survive alone 
feel like I have lose everything that I have know and 
I keep hold on I feel I be where I belong 
every time we fight it feel so wrong 
I feel so enslaved fuck my pride 
then we meet again 
we push we button far inside 
we tear we heart out then we fight 
hey I know 
feel like I have lose everything that I have know and 
I can not survive alone 
feel like I have lose everything that I have know and
