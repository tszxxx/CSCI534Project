[Verse 1]
You think you're a man
You are only a boy
You think you're a man
You are only a toy
You think you're a man
But you just couldn't see
You weren't man enough
To satisfy me
You think you're a man
You are only a boy
You think you're a man
You are only a toy
You think you're a man
But you just couldn't see
You weren't man enough
To satisfy me
[Hook]
Man, boy
Man, boy
Man, boy
Man, boy
[Verse 2]
You think you're a man
But you're only a boy
You think you're a man
But you're only a toy
You think you're a man
But you just couldn't see
You weren't man enough
To satisfy me
[Hook]
