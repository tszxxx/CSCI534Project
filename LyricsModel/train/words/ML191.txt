never as good 
no baby 
good time they come and they go 
never go to know 
what fate be go to blow 
you way just hope that it feel right 
sometimes it come and it go 
you take it ever so slow 
and then you lose it 
then it flow right to you 
so we rely on the past 
special moment that last 
be they as tender 
as we dare to remember 
such a fine time as this 
what could equal the bliss 
the thrill of the first kiss 
it will blow right to you 
it be never as good as the first time 
it be never as good as the first time 
good time they come and they go 
never go to know 
it be like the weather 
one day chicken next day feather 
the rose we remember 
the thorns we forget 
we would love and leave 
we never spend a minute on regret 
it be a possibility the more we know the less we see 
second time be not quite what it seem 
Natural as the way we come to be 
the second time will not live up to the dream 
it be never as good as the first time 
it be never as good as the first time 
Natural as the way we come to be 
second time will not live up to the dream 
it be natural as the way we come to be 
the second time be not quite what it seem 
it be never ooh as good as the first time 
as the first time 
never as good as the first time 
Natural as the way we come to be 
second time will not live up to the dream 
Natural as the way we come to be 
second time be not quite what it seem 
it be never as good as the first time 
as the first time 
as good as the first time
