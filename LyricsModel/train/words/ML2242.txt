bear into a world of hatred 
nothing to live for 
what start with a simple match 
turn into something more 
the pain I feel inside my head 
come on my day of birth 
now the time have come for I 
to burn the planet Earth 
I can feel the fire burn inside of I 
the power 's at my finger wait you shall see 
burn ignite the population 
burn cause mass cremation 
burn feel no shame or pity 
burn apocalyptic city 
year have pass as I stand still 
to plan the final blow 
I will make the town go up in flame 
a hellish death they will know 
as I pour on the gasoline 
I listen deep inside 
I hear the cry of all my victim 
nowhere to run or hide 
I can feel the fire burn inside of I 
the power 's at my finger wait you shall see 
burn ignite the population 
burn cause mass cremation 
burn feel no shame or pity 
burn apocalyptic city 
now my great assault be over 
and my life be do 
stare at my great inferno 
be my only fun 
so I leave you with my tale 
I hear my conscious fall 
a victim of myself 
so now I will end it all 
I can feel the fire burn inside of I 
the power 's at my finger wait you shall see 
burn ignite the population 
burn cause mass cremation 
burn feel no shame or pity 
burn apocalyptic city 
burn
