Color in sky Prussian blue 
scarlet fleece change hue 
Crimson ball sink from view 
wear you love like heaven 
wear you love like heaven 
wear you love like heaven 
Lord kiss I once more 
fill I with song 
Allah kiss I once more 
that I may that I may 
wear my love like heaven 
wear my love like heaven 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Color sky 
Havana lake 
Color sky rose carmethene 
alizarin crimson 
wear you love like heaven 
wear you love like heaven 
wear you love like heaven 
Lord kiss I once more 
fill I with song 
Allah kiss I once more 
that I may that I may 
wear my love like heaven 
wear my love like heaven 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
can not believe what I see 
all I have wish for will be 
all we race proud and free 
wear you love like heaven 
wear you love like heaven 
wear you love like heaven 
Lord kiss I once more 
fill I with song 
Allah kiss I once more 
that I may that I may 
wear my love like heaven 
wear my love like heaven
