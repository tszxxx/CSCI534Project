[Intro]
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
[Verse 1]
I woke up and called this morning
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore
[Verse 2]
I made up the bed we sleep in
I looked at the clock when you creep in
It's 6 a.m. and I'm alone
[Chorus]
Did you know when you go
It's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
[Verse 3]
Your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game
[Verse 4]
Now here comes your secret lover
She'd be unlike any other
Until your guilt goes up in flames
[Chorus]
Did you know when you go
It's the perfect ending
To the bad day Iâ€™d gotten used to spending?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
[Bridge]
Well, maybe nothing lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after
It's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way
[Verse 5]
Did you know, could you tell
You were the only one
That I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong
[Outro]
Did you see me walking by?
Did it ever make you cry?
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
