love oh love oh careless love 
you have fly through my head like wine 
you have wreck the life 
of many a poor girl 
and you nearly spoiled this life of mine 
love oh love oh careless love 
in you clutch of desire 
you have make I break a many true vow 
then you set my very soul on fire 
love oh love oh careless love 
all my happiness bereft 
cause you have fill my heart with weary old blue 
now I be walkin talkin to myself 
love oh love oh careless love 
trust you now it be too late 
you have make I throw my old friend down 
that be why I sing this song of hate 
love oh love oh careless love 
night and day I weep and moan 
you bring the wrong man into this life of mine 
for mysin till judgement I will atone
