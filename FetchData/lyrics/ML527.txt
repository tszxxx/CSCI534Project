[Chorus: will.i.am &amp; (apl.de.ap)]
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
For the dance floor
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire)
For the dance floor
Turn it up
Fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire)
For the dance floor
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
For the dance floor
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn-turn it it up-up
On the dance floor
[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
Feel that heat rising up
Hear that beat, turn it up
Baby, movin', that's what's up
Baby, baby, boombercut
Boombercut
Do that dance
Got me lookin' in a trance
Just like fire when she dance
Someone call the ambulance
[Verse 1: apl.de.ap 
with will.i.am.
]
I like it, you like it
You li-li-like 
futureistic
Just ride it, don't fight it
Ge-ge-ge-get down 
to the music
Don't stop it, get rockin'
It's comin' 
like a bullet
It's burning like fire
So go ahead and 
lose it
[Chorus: will.i.am]
Turn it up
Turn it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
For the dancefloor
[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Will.i.am
Turn it up
Break it down
Shake it off
Mix it now
D-A-V-I-D, take me for the dancefloor
Will. I is on reposition
I'll be cutting like incision
Get a ghetto for the dancefloor (Floor)
[Bridge: will.i.am]
The G, the U, the T, the T, the A
The A-A , we don't play
Weepy, weepy, rock, rock, rock, rock
Sh-sh-shit like every day
Feel the sound, powerful
Mega boots on overload
Electric City pumpin' on the dance-ce-cefloor
[Chorus: will.i.am &amp; (apl.de.ap)]
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
For the dance floor
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire)
For the dance floor-oor
