you be not alone I be with you I be lonely too what 's that song that can not be sung by two a break home a break heart isolate and afraid open up this be a raid I want to get it through to you you be not alone you be not alone every night I stand in you place every tear on every face Tastes the same a break dream a break heart isolate and afraid open up this be a raid I be go to get it through to you you be not alone a open hand a open heart there 's no need to be afraid open up this be a raid I want to get it through to you you be not alone I want to get it through to you you be not alone I be go to get it through to you you be not alone
