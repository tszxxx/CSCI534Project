ooh ooh 
everybody know everybody know 
that you cradle the sun 
live in remorse 
Sky be over 
do not you want to hold I baby 
disappointed go crazy 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
I do not want to see you go the sky be over 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
behind close eye lie the mind ready to awake you 
be you at war with land and all of its creature 
you not so gentle persuasion have be know to wreck economy 
of country of empire the sky be over 
do not you want to hold I baby 
disappointed go crazy 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 
not even from the sun 
not even from the sun 
not even from the sun 
do not you want I to run 
even though you can not afford the sky be over 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
I do not want to see you go the sky be over 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
I do not want to see you go the sky be over 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
I do not want to see you go the sky be over 
even though we can not afford the sky be over 
the sky be over we
