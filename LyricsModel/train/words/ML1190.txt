do not you know 
I have fall in love with you 
for the rest of my whole life through 
do not you know 
I be yours from the very day 
that you happen to come my way 
can not you see 
I be under you spell 
by the look in my eye 
can not you tell can not you tell 
now do not you know 
every beat of my heart keep cry out 
I love you so 
do not you know 
do not you know 
every beat of my heart keep cry out 
I love you so 
do not you know
