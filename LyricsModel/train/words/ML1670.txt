Silent night 
holy night 
all be calm 
all be bright 
round young virgin 
mother and child 
holy infant 
so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace 
sleep in heavenly peace 
Silent night 
holy night 
Son of God 
love pure light 
radiant beam from thy holy face 
with the dawn of redeem grace 
Jesus Lord at thy birth 
Jesus Lord at thy birth 
Silent night 
holy night 
all be calm 
all be bright 
round young virgin 
mother and child 
holy infant 
so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace 
sleep in heavenly peace 
sleep in heavenly peace
