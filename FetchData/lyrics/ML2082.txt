Joy, oh my joy
I don't like it no more 'cause they took my joy
I don't like it no more 'cause they took my joy
They took my joy, I want it back
They took my joy, I want it back
I'm gonna go to West Memphis and look for my joy
Go to West Memphis and look for my joy
Maybe in West Memphis, I'll find my joy
Maybe in West Memphis, I'll find my joy
I'm gonna go to Slidell and look for my joy
Go to Slidell and look for my joy
Maybe in Slidell,  I'll find my joy
Maybe in Slidell, I'll find my joy
They've no right to take my joy, I want it back
They've no right to take my joy, I want it back
I'm gonna go to West Memphis
I'm gonna go to Slidell
