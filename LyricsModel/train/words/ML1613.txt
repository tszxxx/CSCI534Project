I do not mind to give you a slow dance or two 
I be sorry I be not at my best 
I know you can see I be incredibly blue 
but I be not that lonely yet 
I look in you eye while you be dance with I 
and try to fulfill you request 
but do not ask for favor when it be time to leave 
I be not that lonely yet 
now do not say you want I 
I have hear that before 
the word weigh like stone in my head 
there may come a time when I will think of you more 
but I be not that lonely yet 
it be nice to be dance to waltze again 
and maybe it help to forget 
you have open the door but I be not waltze in 
I be not that lonely yet 
I be not that lonely yet
