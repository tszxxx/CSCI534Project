[Refrain]
Loose ends, they tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie me down
Never tie me down
Loose ends, they tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie me down
But never tie me down
[Chorus]
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
[Refrain]
Loose ends tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie us down
They never tie us down
Loose ends tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie us down
But never tie us down
[Chorus]
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
[Instrumental Break]
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
[Chorus]
(Ohhhh) Off I go
(Ohhhh) Where I fall is where I land (Is where I land)
(Ohhhh) Off I go
(Ohhhh) Where I fall is where I land (Is where I land)
