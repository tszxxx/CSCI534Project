[Verse 1]
If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces
Of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased
You held me up to the sunlight
Now it feels like
[Chorus]
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken
[Verse 2]
If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch
Of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night
I swear it's life
[Chorus]
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken
[Bridge]
I still see the night, I fell into your eyes
And when we made love it felt like the first time
[Chorus]
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken
I am unbroken
I am unbroken
[Chorus]
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken...
