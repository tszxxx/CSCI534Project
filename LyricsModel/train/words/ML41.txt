the more of you that I inspect 
the more of I I see reflect 
the more I try to read you lip 
the more the mask you be wear rip 
but when I seek out you voice 
my ear be overcome with noise 
you show and tell with greatest ease 
rave impossibility 
engage in crime I grasp my throat 
enrage my mind start to smoke 
enforce a mental overload 
angry again angry again angry oh 
and when the story take a twist 
it fold like a contortionist 
slight of hand and quick exchange 
the old trick have be rearrange 
the searing of the sinew 
my body fight for air 
the rip of the tissue 
my lung begin to tear 
gravity be get my bone 
it pull my flesh away 
the steam finally dissipate 
I make out my sweaty face 
Association that I choose 
game I inevitably lose 
govern by law set up by I 
fracture it be jaw to let I be 
a cut out cardboard condo maze 
fill with a insubordinate race 
irrational youth stop to stare 
as music rubber hose the air
