when the morning come 
like shift sand 
in a desert storm 
like a rage fire 
heat up the big sky baby 
you love be pure and strong 
chain to you heart I surrender 
here be where I belong 
and if I get emotional and I be restless 
Youâ€™re like a soothing ray of light 
bring to I to my sense in a heart beat darling 
hold I tender in the night 
tell I what miracle be make of 
like the sweet soft morning dew 
how can I ever show you baby 
how can I prove it all to you 
that I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I get so mix up and tongue tie 
I can hardly say my name 
bring to I to my sense in a heart beat darling 
hold I tender in the night 
cos I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
never think this would 
never think this would 
never think this would happen to I 
never think this would 
never think this would 
never think this would happen to I 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love 
I be a woman in love
