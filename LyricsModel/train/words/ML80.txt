do not ya love she madly 
do not ya need she badly 
do not ya love she way 
tell I what you say 
do not you love she madly 
want to be she daddy 
do not ya love she face 
do not ya love she as she be walkin out the door 
like she do one thousand time before 
do not you love she way 
tell I what you say 
do not ya love she as she be walk out the door 
all you love 
all you love 
all you love 
all you love 
all you love be go 
so sing a lonely song 
of a deep blue dream 
Seven horse seem to be on the mark 
yeah do not you love she 
do not you love she as she be walk out the door 
all you love 
all you love 
all you love 
yeah all you love be go 
so sing a lonely song 
of a deep blue dream 
Seven horse seem to be on the mark 
do not you love she madly 
well do not ya love she madly 
do not you love she madly
