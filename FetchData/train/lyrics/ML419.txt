[Verse 1]
I saw you staring at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hiding nothing that I don't know
[Chorus]
There's an old flame burning in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burning longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes
[Verse 2]
You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long
[Chorus][x2]
