please baby can not you see 
my mind be a burnin hell 
I get razor a -rippin and tearin and strippin 
my heart apart as well 
tonight you tell I 
that you ache for something new 
and some other woman be look like something 
that might be good for you 
go on and hold she til the scream be go 
go on believe she when she tell you 
nothing be wrong 
but I be the only one 
who will walk across the fire for you 
I be the only one 
who will drow in my desire for you 
it be only fear that make you run 
the demon that you be hide from 
when all you promise be go 
I be the only one 
please baby can not you see 
I be try to explain 
I have be here before and I be lock the door 
and I be not go back again 
she eye and arm and skin will not make 
it go away 
you will wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow 
that hold you down today 
go on and hold she til the scream be go 
go on believe she when she tell you 
nothing be wrong 
but I be the only one 
who will walk across the fire for you 
and I be the only one 
who will drow in my desire for you 
it be only fear that make you run 
the demon that you be hide from 
when all you promise be go 
I be the only one 
go on and hold she til the scream be go 
go on believe she when she tell you 
nothing be wrong 
but I be the only one 
who will walk across the fire for you 
and I be the only one 
who will drow in my desire for you 
it be only fear that make you run 
the demon that you be hide from 
when all you promise be go 
I be the only one 
and I be the only one 
who will drow in my desire for you 
it be only fear that make you run 
the demon that you be hide from 
when all you promise be go 
I be the only one 
I be the only one 
I be the only one
