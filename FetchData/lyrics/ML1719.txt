Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with..
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
[Chorus 1]
Where is Santa? At his sleigh?
Tell me 
why is it always this way?
Where is Rudolph? Where is Blitzen, baby?
Merry Christmas, merry merry merry Christmas
[Pre-Chorus]
All the children are tucked in their beds
Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Snowball fighting, it's so exciting baby
[Chorus 2]
I love you and you love me
And that's the way it's got to be
I loved you from the start
Because Christmas ain't the time for breaking each other's hearts
[Chorus 1]
Where is Santa? At his sleigh?
Tell me why is it always this way?
Where is Rudolph? Where is Blitzen, baby?
Merry Christmas, merry merry merry Christmas
[Pre-Chorus]
All the children are tucked in their beds
Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Snowball fighting, it's so exciting baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus 2]
I love you and you love me
And that's the way it's got to be
I loved you from the start
Because Christmas ain't the time for breaking each other's hearts
[Outro]
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with... you
