I find my thrill on Blueberry Hill on Blueberry Hill , when I find you the moon stand still on Blueberry Hill and linger until my dream come true the wind in the willow play love 's sweet melody but all of those vow you make be never to be though we be apart , you be part of I still for you be my thrill on Blueberry Hill the wind in the willow play love 's sweet melody but all of those vow you make be only to be though we be apart , you be part of I still for you be my thrill on Blueberry Hill
