Cover up or spread it out
Turn around had enough
Pick and choose or pass it on
Buying in, heading for
Suffer now or suffer then
It's bad enough I want the fear
Need the fear 'cause
He's alone
He's alone
Well if they're making it, then they're pushing it
And they're leading us along
The hassle of all the screaming fits
That panic makes remorse
After all what's the point
Course levitation is possible
If you're a fly achieved and gone
There's time for this and so much more
It's typical, create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope or never care
Just use the key 'cause
He's alone
He's alone
Well if they're making it, then they're pushing it
And they're leading us along
The hassle of all the screaming fits
That panic makes remorse
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave
Well if they're making it, then they're pushing it
And they're leading us along
The hassle of all the screaming fits
That panic held before
Well if they're making it, then they're pushing it
And they're leading us along
Like a cancer caused all the screaming fits
And their panic makes remorse
