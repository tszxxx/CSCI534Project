[Verse 1]
It's coming down, babe
Could be as bad as they talked about
It's coming down, babe
Could be before we can make it out
[Chorus]
But when they say that all is lost
All is not lost, all is not lost
But when they say that all is lost
All is not lost, no, all is not lost at all
[Verse 2]
And they could be right about it
They could be right in some crazy way
'Cause if they yell fire, well, that's what we get
Yeah, they yell fire and that's what we get
[Verse 3]
So, yeah, it's coming, babe
Probably as bad as they talked about
But just remember when the tide rolls in
Can't be too long until it rolls back out
[Chorus]
And when they say that all is lost
All is not lost, all is not lost
And when they say that all is lost
All is not lost, no, all is not lost at all
[Bridge]
And if they burn (burn, burn)
If they burn this place down to the ground
What does it matter?
What does it matter, now?
[Chorus]
'Cause when they say that all is lost
All is not lost, all is not lost
And when they say that all is lost
All is not lost, no, all is not lost, not lost at all
[Outro]
(No, all is not lost at all) No, all is not lost at all
(No, all is not lost at all) No, all is not lost, not lost at all
