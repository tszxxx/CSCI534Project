White chalk written on red brick
Our love told in a heart
It's there, drawn in the playground
Love, kiss, hate, or adore
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
I used to carry her satchels
She used to walk by my side
But when we got to her doorstep
Her dad wouldn't let me inside
One Monday morning
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking
Had she done the same?
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
One Monday morning
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking
Had she done the same?
I hope Jennifer Eccles
Is going to follow me there
Our love is bound to continue
Love, kiss, hate, or adore
Singing
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
Singing
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
La la, la-la la la la
La la, la-la la-la
