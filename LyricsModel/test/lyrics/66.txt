Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woooo [2x]
[Verse 1]
Seen many men in my time
But none of them compare to mine
I ain't gotta knock on wood
To tell y’all that I got it so good
He's everything that I need and
All that a man should be
Put me on a flight if I wanna
Buy out the mall if I wanna
[Hook]
And I know ya'll heard before
These same old metaphors
My love is so much more
I don’t wanna change it
I don’t wanna do without ya baby
Cause he’s just above the rest
I must confess the best
Love that I’ve ever had
And I just gotta let you know this
[Chorus]
Don’t let ‘em tell you nothing different
You’re the only one I’m needing
I don’t want no one but you
Baby no one will do
And what they say don’t even matter
They don’t know what I know about ya
I don’t want no one but you
Baby no one will do
[Verse 2]
It’s me and him through the wire
Cause when it comes to love he delivers
My personal UPS
I’m sending him an SOS
That I love him and I want him
And don’t wanna replace him with nobody else
I’mma keep holding on
I’mma keep the loving strong, ayayyyy
[Hook]
[Chorus]
I don’t want nobody, nobody, nobody, no, no, no, no-body but you
I don’t want nobody, I don’t want nobody
You’re the only one for me boo ohhohhh
