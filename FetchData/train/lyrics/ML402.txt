[Verse 1]
Out on the highway, a lot of pretty girls go by
But none have been right
Up until today, I would never settle down
But you keep coming around
[Chorus]
And your love is a miracle, it's spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle, it's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine
[Verse 2]
Out in the wildlife, a lot of people telling lies
Lookin' right in your eyes
And up until tonight, I was always on the prowl
But now I'm settlin' down
[Chorus]
‘Cause your love is a miracle, it's spiritual
Stands the test of time
Your love is a miracle, it's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine
[Bridge]
Anyone can see what you're doing to me
And everyone can see that you're everything I need
[Chorus]
‘Cause your love is a miracle, it's spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle, it's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine
