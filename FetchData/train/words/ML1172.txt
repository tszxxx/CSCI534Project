if I could make a wish I think I would pass can not think of anythin ' I need no cigarett , no sleep , no light , no sound nothing to eat , no book to read make love with you have leave I peaceful , warm , and tired what more could I ask there 's nothing leave to be desire peace come upon I and it leave I weak so sleep , silent angel go to sleep sometimes , all I need be the air that I breathe and to love you all I need be the air that I breathe yes , to love you all I need be the air that I breathe peace come upon I and it leave I weak so sleep , silent angel go to sleep sometimes , all I need be the air that I breathe and to love you all I need be the air that I breathe yes , to love you all I need be the air that I breathe sometimes , all I need be the air that I breathe and to love you all I need be the air that I breathe yes , to love you all I need be the air that I breathe and to love you all I need be the air that I breathe yes , to love you
