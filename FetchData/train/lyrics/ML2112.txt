Hey you, say you wanna start over again
Like I ever wanted it to be any different
I've been watching all your colors fade to blue
Said you'd come back like I want you, want you
Stop pretending everything's all right, oh
Baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Your black and white needs a little bit of red, ooh
Couldn't handle pressure life had put you through
Thought you might have bit a little more than you could chew
No, I don't believe it when you say I will make it up to you
Said you'd come back, didn't want you to, want you to
Still pretending everything's alright, oh
Baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Baby blue, oh, oh
Baby blue, oh, oh
Oh, baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Oh, baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
