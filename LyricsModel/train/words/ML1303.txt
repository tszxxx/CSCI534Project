I be a -havin a nervous breakdow and 
a mental shakedow and 
see my hand how they shiver 
see my knee how they quiver 
my whole body be in a jitter 
I be a -havin a nervous breakdow and 
I go to see the doctor just the other day 
I get to tell you what he have to say 
well he say hey boy you just get to slow down 
you can not keep a -traipsin all over town 
after givin you a physical check 
I have come to the conclusion you be a total wreck 
I be a -havin a nervous breakdow and 
a mental shakedow and 
see my hand how they shiver 
see my knee how they quiver 
my whole body be in a jitter 
I be a -havin a nervous breakdow and 
I have make up my mind I would better change my way 
my shattered nerve have see better day 
no more guy for a week or two 
no more runnin' round with the usual crew 
no more movie or stayin out late 
my baby 's get to find himself another date 
I be a -havin a nervous breakdow and 
a mental shakedow and 
I be havin a nervous breakdow and 
I be havin a nervous breakdow and 
I be havin a nervous breakdow and 
a nervous breakdown 
a nervous breakdown 
a nervous breakdown 
I be havin a nervous breakdow and 
a nervous breakdown 
a nervous breakdown 
a nervous breakdown
