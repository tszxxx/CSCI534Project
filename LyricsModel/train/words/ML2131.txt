get a good reason for love you 
it be a old fashioned sign 
I kinda get the feeling like mmm you know when 
I fall in love the first time 
kind woman will not you love I tonight 
the look in you eye 
kind woman do not leave I lonely tonight 
please say it be all right 
remember once before you be hear the old folk say 
love be a ageless old rhyme 
now a day you know they be say depend so much on 
the kind of woman that you find 
kind woman will not you love I tonight 
the look in you eye 
kind woman do not leave I lonely tonight 
be you say it be all right 
kind woman will not you love I tonight 
the look in you eye 
kind woman do not leave I lonely tonight 
please say it be all right
