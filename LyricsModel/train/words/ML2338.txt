we leave we home behind now we be follow the wolf 's trail 
through the deepest forest beneath the star we ride 
I can see the moon glow red like the blood of warrior 
there be a prophecy that tonight many man will die 
the fire will burn forever in we passionate heart 
we destiny be call we now 
we be ready to take they life 
into battle we ride with god by we side 
we be strong and not afraid to die 
we have a urge to kill and we lust for blood have to be fulfil 
we will fight till the end and send we enemy straight to Hell 
prominent leader cast you sword in the wind as a sign of war 
man prepare for death cause we might never return 
Blood will spill and head will fall 
as the sword sparkle light the night 
the ground rumble as we attack 
in the throe of rage we will fight 
the lightning 's flash the thunder 's roar 
will petrify the weak 
we will show no mercy we will kill they all 
we be swear in the name of steel 
into battle we ride with god by we side 
we be strong and not afraid to die 
we have a urge to kill and we lust for blood have to be fulfil 
we will fight till the end and send we enemy straight to Hell 
into battle we ride with god by we side 
we be strong and not afraid to die 
we have a urge to kill and we lust for blood have to be fulfil 
we will fight till the end and send we enemy straight to Hell
