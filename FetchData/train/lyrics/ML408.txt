[Verse 1]
Pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry
It's just that I noticed you going out of your mind
Looks like we're two of a kind
[Chorus]
Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart?
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms
[Verse 2]
Alone is much better together
And the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest of the tears
That are left from two hearts that just came undone
Why should we go crazy alone?
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms
