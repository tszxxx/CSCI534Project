a candy - color clown they call the sandman tiptoe to my room every night just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper " go to sleep . everything be all right . " I close my eye , then I drift away into the magic night , I softly say a silent prayer like dreamer do then I fall asleep to dream , my dream of you in dream I walk with you , in dream I talk to you in dream you be mine , all of the time we be together in dream , in dream but just before the dawn , I awake and find you go I can not help it , I can not help it , if I cry I remember that you say goodbye it 's too bad that all these thing can only happen in my dream only in dream , in beautiful dream
