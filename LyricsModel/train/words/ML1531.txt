oh baby I want to come home to you 
baby I get to get home to you 
day and night feel so blue 
Lord I just do not know what I be go to do 
oh baby I want to come home 
oh baby you be one thousand mile away 
baby you be just one thousand mile away 
take these chain from round my heart 
never leave you no more you never depart 
baby let I come on home to you 
oh I love you baby let I come on home 
please baby let I come on home to you girl 
cry my eye out over you 
I do not know nothing in the world that I be go to do 
but Iâ€™m go to 
come on girl say it I get to get home 
yeah baby girl I love you honey 
please let I come home
