you know I can not smile without you 
I can not smile without you 
I can not laugh and I can not sing 
I be find it hard to do anything 
you see I feel sad when you be sad 
I feel glad when you be glad 
if you only know what I be go through 
I just can not smile without you 
you come along just like a song 
and brighten my day 
who would have believe that you be part of a dream 
now it all seem light year away 
and now you know I can not smile without you 
I can not smile without you 
I can not laugh and I can not sing 
I be find it hard to do anything 
you see I feel sad when you be sad 
I feel glad when you be glad 
if you only know what I be go through 
I just can not smile 
now some people say happiness take so very long to find 
well I be find it hard leave you love behind I 
and you see I can not smile without you 
I can not smile without you 
I can not laugh and I can not sing 
I be find it hard to do anything 
you see I feel glad when you be glad 
I feel sad when you be sad 
if you only know what I be go through 
I just can not smile without you 
can not smile without you 
can not smile without you 
can not laugh and I can not sing 
I be find it hard to do anything
