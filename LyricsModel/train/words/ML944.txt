you be the love of my life 
and you be the reason I be alive 
and baby baby baby 
when I think of how you save I 
I go crazy 
I have never know love like this 
and it fill I with a new tenderness 
and I know I know I know 
you be in my heart you be in my soul 
you be all I can not resist 
and I need to tell you 
the first time I hold you I know 
you be the love of my life 
I spend a lifetime waiting 
always hesitate until you 
I be lose so deep inside my shell 
til you come and save I from myself 
now all I really know be I need you 
and you be the love of my life 
all the joy and tear that I cry 
and baby baby baby 
you do not have to say a word 
I see it in you eye 
as we stand together 
I promise forever till the day that I die 
you be the love of my life 
I spend a lifetime waiting 
always hesitate until you 
I be lose so deep inside my shell 
til you come and save I from myself 
now all I really know be I need you 
you be the love of my life 
and you be the reason I be alive
