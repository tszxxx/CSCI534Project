Alright!
[Verse 1]
My dirthouse
Watch it happen from a box
Mind wanders
Dirty dirty word
My dirthouse
This is where it all comes down
Look into my eye
You feel my skin, its dirt
[Verse 2]
Drive me wild
Remember when you blew my mind?
Cut through me
Living in the dirt
These dogs are curled up in a little ball
These dogs are freezing their asses off
[Chorus]
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own
[Solo]
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own
[Solo 2]
Open the box
See whats inside
You make the call
Sick of it all again
[Verse 3]
Tear me down
Pushing on my every nerve
Scares me
I hope i don't get burnt
Look closer
Look into my dirty mind
Feeling sick inside
My blood has turned to fucking dirt
[Chorus]
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own
