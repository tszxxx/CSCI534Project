young dumb do not see a problem 
bloodshot stare like a hoodlum 
simple as this â€ I be in love with the risk 
I know what I have do 
but tell I what do I miss 
so please do not save something 
waste not save nothing 
lose the halo do not need to resist 
a lick of the lip and a grip on you hip 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
first thing we succumb to 
shall erase and undo day of unrelease 
if there be no police 
race to slip into whatever fit you 
make something make someone 
beg on a knee baby baby please 
pout you bottom lip while crack the whip 
you know what we want be candy to cum to 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
eternal eclipse in the tooth of the risk 
the tongue be a twist in perpetual bliss 
forever midnight 
forever midnight 
forever midnight 
forever 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
baby baby come out 
c- c- c c come out 
baby baby come out 
c- c- c c come out 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist 
sick sick sick 
do not resist
