do not we break the silence 
do not we fear the storm 
do not we move the earth 
do not we shoot for the sky 
and do not we catch the fire 
and do not we call upon the spirit 
and do not we fall together 
and do not we die for love 
day on the run 
night in hiding 
hope that you be 
the healing inside I 
breathe in the sweet fire of love 
I be not afraid anymore 
sweet sweet fire 
I be not alone 
breathe in the sweetest fire of love 
I be not the same anymore 
sweet sweet fire 
the sweet fire of love 
the sweet fire of love 
do not we cross new water 
do not we mix new blood 
do not we build brand new bridge 
do not we hold back the flood 
break idol by the side of the road 
they do not fall on the side of the law 
here she come a-shine like a light 
here she come salvation in the night 
day on the run 
night in hiding 
hope that you be 
the healing inside I 
breathe in the sweet fire of love 
I be not afraid anymore 
sweet sweet fire 
I be not alone 
breathe in the sweet fire of love 
I be not the same anymore 
sweet sweet fire 
the sweet fire of love 
the sweet fire of love 
do not we shine like silver 
do not we bear the cross 
do not we bring down the hammer 
do not we beat on the drum 
day on the run 
here she come a-shine like a light 
night in hiding 
here she come salvation in the night 
hope that you be 
I be give up the ghost 
the healing inside I 
I be give up the ghost 
breathe in the sweet fire of love 
I be not afraid anymore 
sweet sweet fire 
I be not alone 
breathe in the sweetest fire of love 
I be not the same anymore 
sweet sweet fire 
the sweet fire of love 
the sweet fire of love 
Fire of love 
Fire of love
