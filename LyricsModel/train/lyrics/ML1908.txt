Feels like the walls are closing in on me
I'm suffocating, I can barely breathe
And you've got me right where you want me
This is a side of you I've never seen
You're not the girl that you used to be
And you've got me right where you want me
You always know how to bring me down
Let's just face it now
I'm never changing
You are my world
My everything
You stupid girl
You will be the death of me
So let me go
Just let me be
You stupid girl
You love the way you're killing me
(You're killing me)
You stupid girl
You're like an angel but with broken wings
A heart so cold could never show mercy
And you've got me right where you want me
You are my world
My everything
You stupid girl
You will be the death of me
So let me go
Just let me be
You stupid girl
You love the way you're killing me
(You're killing me)
You stupid girl
(You're killing me)
You stupid girl
I know I'm a bastard
But I'm not a coward
(But can't you see what you're doing to me?)
I'm falling faster
More every hour
(
Why can't you see what you're doing to me?)
Open your eyes!
Open your eyes
!
This is killing me
You are my world
My everything
You stupid girl
Gonna be the death of me
So let me go
Just let me be
You stupid girl
Love the way you're killing me
(You're killing me)
You stupid girl
(You're killing me)
You stupid girl
