For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
There's some people up there hoggin' everything
Tellin' lies, givin' alibis about the peoples money and things
And if they gonna throw it away, might as well give some to me
Yeah, they seen and heard it, but never had misery
There are some people who are starvin' to death
Never knew but only hate us, and they never had happiness
Ohoho, if you don't have enough to eat, how can you think of love?
You don't have the time to care so it's crime you're guilty of, oh yeah
For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake, why don't you give more power to the people?
Cut this jive and see who's got the power to kill the most
When they run out of power, the world's gonna be a ghost
They know were not satisfied, so we begin to holler
Makin' us a promise and throwin' a few more dollars
There's no price for happiness, there's no price for love
Up goes the price of livin', and you're right back where you was
So whatever you got, just be glad you got it
Now we're gonna get on up and get some more of it, oh yeah
For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake, why don't you give more power to the people?
For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake, why don't you give more power to the people?
For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake, why don't you give more power to the people?
For God's sake, you got to have it, more power
For God's sake, you got to have it, more power
For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake, why don't you give more power to the people?
For God's sake, you got to give more power to the people
For God's sake, why don't you give more power to the people?
