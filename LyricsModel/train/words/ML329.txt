and there be day when the pain just last and last 
but I know there will come a day 
when all we tear be wash away with a break in the cloud

that God be love and love have come for we all 
every heart set free everyone will see 
that God be love and love have come for we all 
for anybody who have ever lose a love one 
and you feel like you have to let go too soon 
I know it hurt to say goodbye 
but do not you know it be just a matter of time til the tear be go to end 
you will see he once again and in that moment 
every knee shall bow every tongue confess 
that God be love and love have come for we all 
every heart set free everyone will see

oh and on that day we will stand amazed 
at we savior God and king
