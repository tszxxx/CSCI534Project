I sit here on the stair and listen to 
the night time as the daylight fade away 
it be such a haunting and familiar tune 
when I hear it in the distance I can say 
that I be home in Massachusetts 
where my daughter and my wife they wait for I 
all alone but the truth be 
it be where I always be it be where I long to be 
because I be home 
the North Shore be where my father live 
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride 
but the Berkshires be where my heart be 
and when I see they in the distance I could cry 
because I be home in Massachusetts 
where my daughter and my wife they wait for I 
all alone but the truth be 
it be where I always be it be where I long to be 
Nyla start pre-school and Indie just turn two 
and Zoe be just the perfect mix of I and you 
they keep get older and time keep go by 
to think about it make you daddy want to cry 
so I just pass the sign that welcome I to Worthington 
establish long before this country come to be 
a place that hasnâ€™t really change with time 
the way this country that I love it use to be 
because I be home in Massachusetts 
where my daughter and my wife they wait for I 
all alone but the truth be 
it be where I always be it be where I long to be 
because I be home in Massachusetts 
where my hero teach class every day 
where my friend do not treat I different 
it be where my family be it be where I will always stay 
because I be home
