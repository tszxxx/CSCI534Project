Glass of gin and a folding chair 
sit out by the wading pool chlorine blue 
rush of wind pass over I restless night 
restless night 
restless night 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
my love 's another kind 
my love 's another kind 
my love 's another kind 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
chin up cheer up chin up cheer up chin up 
my love 's another kind
