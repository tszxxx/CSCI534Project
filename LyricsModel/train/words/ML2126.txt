well I open up the bottle and I fall out of bed 
I could not find the floor until it hit I in the head 
I do a little powder off the bathroom sink 
it be be about a month and something 's start to stink 
I and the band we be start to fight 
because if we get along it just would not feel right 
we be the white trash circus do not give a damn 
we will steal you girl whenever we can and 
we be the drunken god 's of the living dead 
we be the voice we be the voice 
we be the voice in you head 
we be the trash we be the trash 
we be the trash in you bed 
I be live on the road about a year and half 
if we go another mile we be go to kick each other 's ass 
someone be go to quit or someone be go to die 
we do not give a shit because we be busy get high 
another lawsuit another arrest 
we would not change a thing because we love it to death 
we be the son' of devil we be the blood on the stage 
you can love we you can hate we but we will never go away 
we be the voice we be the voice 
we be the voice in you head 
we be the voice we be the voice 
we be the voice in you head 
we be the trash we be the trash 
we be the trash in you bed
