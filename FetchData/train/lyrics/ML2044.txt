[Verse 1:]
Said the nightman to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see
[Chorus:]
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite[x2]
[Verse 2:]
Said the little lamb to the shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky, shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
[Chorus:]
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea[x2]
[Verse 3:]
Said the shepard boy the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know
[Chorus:]
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver a gold
Let us bring him silver and gold
[Bridge:]
Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say
[Chorus:]
A child, a child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light[x2]
