we have love 
we have love 
we have love 
we have love 
we have love give it up give it up 
there be nothing else to be proud of 
we have lose nothing 
keep that think firm in you mind 
when you look but you do not find 
what you can offer 
we have lose nothing 
I keep that think firm in my mind 
when I look but I do not find 
what I can offer 
I do not always know 
what it be you mean to show 
but I keep it close to mine 
and we discover 
I think my heart be damage 
I think my heart be strong 
a thought be nothing damage 
a thought be nothing wrong 
I see it in my care for you 
I see it in my care for you 
we have love 
give it up give it up 
there be nothing else to be proud of 
we have love 
give it up give it up 
there be nothing else to be proud of
