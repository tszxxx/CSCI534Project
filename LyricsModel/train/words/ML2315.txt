you give you love so sweetly 
tonight the light of love be in you eye 
but will you love I tomorrow 
be this a lasting treasure 
or just a moment 's pleasure 
can I believe the magic of you sigh 
will you still love I tomorrow 
tonight with word unspoken 
you say that I be the only one 
but will my heart be break 
when the night meet the morning sun 
I would like to know that you love 
be love I can be sure of 
so tell I now and I will not ask again 
will you still love I tomorrow 
so tell I now and I will not ask again 
will you still love I tomorrow 
will you still love I tomorrow 
will you still love I tomorrow
