come and give I that Wildfire 
the uncivilized sound that I love 
the primitive like a blaze style 
consciousness vibe I and I know 
the untamed flame that I desire 
I want uncultivated Jah glow 
foolish intensity versatile 
he will fly the spirit high take I higher 
one lead with the passion 
the righteous will burn again 
one bleed everlasting 
tribal fire will never end 
one lead with the passion 
the righteous will burn again 
one bleed everlasting 
tribal fire never end 
I want to feel that Wildfire 
irregular burn of the sun 
shine through make you spit fire 
Savage combustion let it go 
impetuous fervor testifier 
outlandish passion I know 
crucial rhythm no denial 
musical nation Empire 
one lead with the passion 
the righteous will burn again 
one bleed everlasting 
tribal fire will never end 
one lead with the passion 
the righteous will burn again 
one bleed everlasting 
tribal fire never end 
one lead with the passion 
tribal fire will never end 
the righteous will burn again 
tribal fire will never end 
one bleed everlasting 
tribal fire will never end 
tribal fire will never end 
one lead with the passion 
the righteous will burn again 
one bleed everlasting 
tribal fire never end
