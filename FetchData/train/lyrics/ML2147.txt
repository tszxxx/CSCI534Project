Faster, louder, my love for you
Bigger, bolder, my love for you
There's no sense trying to make this smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart
Taller, stronger, my love for you
Whiter, brighter, my love for you
There's no point trying to sound smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart
Hotter, wetter
Larger, longer
No no no there's no sense trying to make this smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart
