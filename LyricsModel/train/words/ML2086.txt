Mark out the point

light up the fire 
put on you mask

of beloved mother of liberty 
hold I in you arm 
burn burn burn brightly 
burn burn burn white heat 
burn burn burn brightly 
burn burn burn white heat 
and the day will come 
before the light go out 
who will you turn to 
who will you turn to 
choose the crucifixion 
or Osiris slain 
recur theme 
time again

Ezekiel 's chariot streak across the sky
