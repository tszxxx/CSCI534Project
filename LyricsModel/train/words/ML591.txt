you pretend you be high 
pretend you be bored 
pretend you be anything 
just to be adore 
and what you need 
be what you get 
do not believe in fear 
do not believe in faith 
do not believe in anything 
that you can not break 
you stupid girl 
you stupid girl 
all you have you waste 
all you have you waste 
what drive you on 
can drive you mad 
a million lie to sell yourself 
be all you ever have 
do not believe in love 
do not believe in hate 
do not believe in anything 
that you can not waste 
you stupid girl 
you stupid girl 
can not believe you fake it 
can not believe you fake it 
do not believe in fear 
do not believe in pain 
do not believe in anyone 
that you can not tame 
you stupid girl 
you stupid girl 
all you have you waste 
all you have you waste 
you stupid girl 
you stupid girl 
I can not believe you fake it 
I can not believe you fake it 
stupid girl 
you stupid girl 
can not believe you fake it 
can not believe you fake it 
you stupid girl
