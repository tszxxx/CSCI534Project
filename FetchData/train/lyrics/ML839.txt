[Verse 1]
God Bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her, and guide her
Through the night with the light from above
[Chorus]
From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans, wide with hope
God Bless America
My home sweet home
[Verse 2]
God Bless America
My home sweet home
God Bless America
[Chorus]
From the mountains, to the praries
To the oceans, wide with hope
God Bless America
My home sweet home
God Bless America
