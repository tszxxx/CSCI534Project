verse 1 
I speak to myself sometimes 
and I say 
oh my 
in a lot of way 
you be a lucky guy 
now all you need be a chance to try 
any love 
in my heart 
there be a need to shout 
dying 
screaming 
cry let I out 
be all those feeling that want to touch 
any love 
what a world for the lonely guy 
sometimes I feel 
I be go to lose my mind 
can anybody tell I 
just where to find any love 
any love 
everyone need a love no doubt 
any love 
any love 
everybody feel alone without 
any love 
any love 
I know there be a love 
wait to enter my life 
enter my life 
every day as I live 
I try to think positive 
I pray for someone good to come 
any love 
love be sweet and so divine 
and I can not wait 
for my love life to shine 
can anybody tell I 
where I can find any love 
any love 
I know there be someone wait for I 
to enter my life 
come into my life 
suddenly I be up in clear blue sky 
Lonely tear start to fill my eye 
I can weep 
but I refuse to cry 
I have get to keep hold on 
to think love be strong 
to keep hold on 
and I know 
I know I know 
I know she will come into my life 
come into my life
