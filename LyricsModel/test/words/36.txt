it start all over again the moment I look in you eye it start all over again the thrill we can never disguise the day that we part , so break heart will never return again dream I have delay , promise make be start anew , just for you it start all over again the moment I hold you so tight it start all over again when we kiss away the night - till dawn 's early light now be together , sweetheart forever we will build we romance anew it start all over again the moment I look at you
