[Intro]
You take away
I feel the same
[Verse 1]
You take away
I feel the same
All the promises you made
To me you made in vain
I lost myself inside your
Tainted smile again
[Refrain]
'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Drivin' me insane
I can't fight these feelin's
They will bring you pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again
[Verse 2]
I feel betrayed
Stuck in your ways
And you rip me apart
With the brutal things you say
I can't deal with this shit anymore
I just look away
[Refrain]
'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Drivin' me insane
I can't fight these feelin's
They bring only pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again
[Interlude]
Mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel
Mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel
[Verse 3]
You take away
I feel the same
All these promises
You promised only pain
If you take away
And leave me with nothing again
[Refrain]
'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Drivin' me insane
I can't fight these feelin's
They will bring me pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again
You will feel my anger
You will feel my pain
You will feel my torment
Drivin' you insane
I can't fight these feelin's
They will bring you pain
You won't take away
I'll be whole again
[Outro]
Mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel
Mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel
