why be I stand on a cloud 
every time you be around 
and my sadness disappear 
every time you be near 
you must be a angel 
I can see it in you eye 
full of wonder and surprise 
and just now I realize 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel in disguise 
I can see it in you eye 
walk down a crowded avenue 
other face seem like nothing next to you 
and I can not hear the traffic rush by 
just the pounding of my heart and that be why 
you must be a angel 
I can see it in you eye 
full of wonder and surprise 
and just now I realize 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel in disguise 
I can see it in you eye 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel in disguise 
I can see it in you eye 
you be a angel 
you be a angel baby 
you be a angel 
you must be a angel 
now I believe that dream come true 
cause you come when I wish for you 
this just can not be coincidence 
the only way that this make sense be that 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel in disguise 
I can see it in you eye 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel 
ooh you be a angel in disguise 
I can see it in you eye 
you be a angel 
you be a angel baby 
you be a angel 
you must be a angel baby 
cloud just disappear
