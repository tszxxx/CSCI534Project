there be the moon ask to stay 
long enough for the cloud to fly I away 
well it be my time come I be not afraid afraid to die 
my fading voice sing of love 
but she cry to the click of time oh time 
wait in the fire wait in the fire 
wait in the fire wait in the fire 
and she weep on my arm 
walk to the bright light in sorrow 
oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow oh my love 
and the rain be fall and I believe my time have come 
it remind I of the pain I might leave leave behind 
wait in the fire wait in the fire 
wait in the fire wait in the fire 
I might leave leave behind 
and I feel they drow my name 
so easy to know and forget with this kiss 
I be not afraid to go but it go so slow 
wait in the fire wait in the fire oh oh yea oh oh oh yeah unh 
wait wait wait in the fire wait in the fire 
wait in the fire wait ah uh unh ah
