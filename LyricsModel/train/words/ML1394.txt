I do not think it be right 
lettin love ruin my life 
but I do not think it be wrong 
gettin a little revenge in a song 
it hurt do not lie 
who you go to run to 
who you go to run to now 
you know I would a die for you for you 
but it be not like you love I anyhow 
you know I be right 
you know I be right 
maybe I be wrong 
maybe I be livin a little headstrong 
but no it be not right 
startin a war by avoid a fight 
it hurt do not lie 
who you go to run to 
who you go to run to now 
you know I would a die for you 
but it be not like you love I anyhow 
you know I be right 
you know I be right 
who you go to run to 
who you go to run to now 
who you go to run to 
who you go to run to now 
who you go to run to 
who you go to run to now 
who you go to run to 
who you go to run to now
