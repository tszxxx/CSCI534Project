do unto other as they have do to you 
but what the hell be this world come to 
blow the universe into nothingness 
nuclear warfare shall lay we to rest 
fight fire with fire 
ending be near 
fight fire with fire 
burst with fear 
we all shall die 
time be like a fuse short and burn fast 
armageddon be here like say in the past 
fight fire with fire 
ending be near 
fight fire with fire 
burst with fear 
soon to fill we lung the hot wind of death 
the god be laugh so take you last breath 
fight fire with fire 
ending be near 
fight fire with fire 
burst with fear 
fight fire with fire fight fire with fire 
fight fire with fire fight fire with fire 
fight fire with fire fight fire with fire 
fight fire with fire fight fire with fire 
fight
