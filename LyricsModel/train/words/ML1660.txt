let it be Christmas everywhere 
in the heart of all people 
both near and afar 
Christmas everywhere 
feel the love of the season where ever you be 
on the small country road 
line with green mistletoe 
big city street where a thousand light glow 
let it be Christmas everywhere 
let heavenly music fill the air 
let every heart sing 
let every bell ring 
the story of hope and joy and peace 
and let it be Christmas everywhere 
let heavenly music fill the air 
let anger and fear and hate disappear 
let there be love that last through the year 
and let it be Christmas Christmas everywhere 
let it be Christmas everywhere 
with the gold and the silver the green and the red 
Christmas everywhere 
in the smile of all child asleep in they bed 
in the eye of young baby 
they first fall snow 
the elderly 's memory that never grow old 
let it be Christmas everywhere 
in the song that we sing 
and the gift that we bring 
Christmas everywhere 
in what this day mean 
and what we believe 
from the sandy white beach 
where blue water roll 
snow cover mountain and valley below 
Christmas everywhere
