[Verse 1]
Crystal river
Got a woman on the other side
Crystal river
Got a woman on the other side
[Chorus]
And nothin' can touch me here
Nothin' can touch me here
Nothin' can touch me here
On crystal river
[Verse 2]
I love her
I swear by the diamond sky
I love her
I swear by the diamond sky
[Chorus]
And nothin' can touch me here
And nothin' can touch me here
And nothin' can touch me here
On crystal river
[Verse 3]
I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' where the water's wide
Crystal river
Got a woman on the other side
[Chorus]
And nothin' can touch me here
Nothin' can touch me here
No, nothin' can touch me here
On crystal river
[Verse 4]
She's sleeping
Sleeping by the waterside
She's sleeping
Out there on that bank she lies
[Chorus]
And nothin' can touch me here
Nothin' can touch me here
No, nothin' can touch me here
On crystal river
