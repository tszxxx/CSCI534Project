[Verse 1]
I'm fine
Don't believe it
You know me enough to know that's a lie
I'm close
Hard as it is to say
To total disaster, barely holding on
[Chorus]
I need you now
I need you now, don't turn away
I need you now, oh
Please don't turn me away
I need you now
I need you now
[Verse 2]
Out here
Where I've been spinning
It's nearly impossible to slow down
One night of your company
Might be the only thing to keep me sane
[Pre-Chorus]
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
(Don't turn me away, don't turn me away)
[Chorus]
I need you now
I need you now, don't turn away
I need you now, oh
Please don't turn me away
I need you now
I need you now
[Bridge]
How many times have I come to you, vulnerable like this?
I know you have the right to question, but please don't ask
[Pre-Chorus]
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
(Oh, I need you now)
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
(Don't turn me away, don't turn me away)
[Chorus]
I need you now
I need you now, don't turn away
I need you now, oh
Please don't turn me away
I need you now
I need you now
[Outro]
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
