[Verse 1]
Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers
[Chorus]
You got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead
[Bridge]
See what's ruling all our lives
See who's pulling the strings
See what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place
[Verse 2]
The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
So pull yourself stupid and rob yourself blind
[Chorus]
You got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead
[Solo]
[Chorus]
You got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief in your head
Be quick... or be dead!
Be quick!
