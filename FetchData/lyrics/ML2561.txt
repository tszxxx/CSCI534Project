[Verse 1]
I see trees of green red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
[Chorus]
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[Verse 2]
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days the dark sacred nights
[Chorus]
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[Bridge]
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying 'I love you'
[Verse 3]
I hear babies crying, watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
[Chorus]
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
