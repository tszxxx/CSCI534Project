stand in line as we march to the drum of the east 
paralyze and possess by 
crusader 
deceased 
lose to the siren that call from the turbulent tide 
bound by the science that live on the lip of the wise 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization 
lose in the silence they bow to the call of the east 
tantalize and seduce by the demon release 
ear to the ground by the whim of the merciless sky 
onto the fire that burn in the all see eye 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization 
the beating of a million drum 
the fire of a million gun 
the mother of a million son 
civilization
