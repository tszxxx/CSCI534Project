this be the way you leave I 
I be not pretend 
no hope no love no glory 
no happy end 
this be the way that we love 
like it be forever 
then live the rest of we life 
but not together 
wake up in the morning 
stumble out my eye 
can not get no love without sacrifice 
if anything should happen 
I guess I would wish you well 
a little bit of heaven 
but a little bit of hell 
this be the hardest story 
that I have ever tell 
no hope no love no glory 
happy ending go forever more 
I feel as if I be waste 
and I be waste every day 
this be the way you leave I 
I be not pretend 
no hope no love no glory 
no happy end 
this be the way that we love 
like it be forever 
then live the rest of we life 
but not together 
two o'clock in the morning 
something be on my mind 
can not get no rest 
keep walk around 
if I pretend that nothing ever go wrong 
I could get to my sleep 
I could think that we just carry on 
this be the hardest story 
that I have ever tell 
no hope no love no glory 
happy ending go forever more 
I feel as if I be waste 
I be waste every day 
this be the way you leave I 
I be not pretend
