[Verse 1]
You're deaf to it, blind to it
It's like a thunderclap
Feel the prickles running
Up and down your back
Why so divine, the pain of love
You have to work at it, stay with it
Pay for it, bust your ass
Lie about it, cheat for it
Forget about your past
[Chorus]
Why so divine, the pain of love?
You dream of it passionate
You get a rise from it
[Bridge]
Feel the hot cum
Dripping on your thighs from it
Why why so divine, the pain of love
Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it
Women will die for it
[Verse 2]
Looking back, cut the crap
Was it really worth the rap?
It's hard to survive the pain of love
Ooh I need a time out
Time to make my mind up
Substitute a line out
I'll be back next season with a bang
No release from the jail
No parole, no bail
Hard labor, fifty lashes
Hard labor, money splashes
It's hard to survive the pain of love
The old maid is roughed up
Applying final touches
Even though she's late for the dance
I am telling you tonight she's really got to have a ball
[Bridge]
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
[Chorus]
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
That's what they call it: the pain of love
Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up
[Outro]
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
