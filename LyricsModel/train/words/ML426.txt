do not even like to think about it 
I do not know what I would do without it 
I only know I live and breathe for you love 
baby you come to I in my time of need 
when I need you you be there for I 
baby the love from you be what get I through 
it be because of you I be able to 
give my heart again you give I 
someone to love 
someone to touch 
someone to hold 
someone to know 
someone to love 
someone to trust 
someone to hold 
oh someone to know 
I think I would never love again 
I think my life be over and 
I do not want to face nor even see another day 
suddenly from nowhere baby you appear 
you dry my tear you care for I 
baby you love for I truly rescue I 
it be because of you I be able to 
fall in love again you give I 
someone to love 
someone to touch

someone to know

someone to trust 
someone to hold 
oh someone to know

Babyface 

for so long in my life I would not let love inside 
but I swallow my pride the day you arrive 
now that you be by my side 
everything be all right 
it be because of you I be able to 
give my heart again you give I 
someone to love 
someone to touch 
someone to hold 
someone to know 
someone to love 
someone to trust 
someone to hold 
oh someone to know 
someone to love 
someone to touch 
someone to hold 
someone to know 
someone to love 
someone to trust 
someone to hold 
oh someone to know
