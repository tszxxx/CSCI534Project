[Intro]
(Scatting)
[Verse 1: Kenny Loggins]
Whenever I call you "friend"
I begin to think I understand
Anywhere we are
You and I have always been
Ever and ever
[Verse 2: 
((Both))
]
((I see myself within your eyes))
((And that's all I need to show me why))
((Everything I do always takes me home to you))
(Ever and ever)
[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Loggins, 
(Stevie Nicks)
]
Now I know my life has given me more than memories
Day by day
We can see
(In every moment there's a reason to carry on)
[Chorus: 
((Both))
]
((Sweet love's showing us a heavenly light))
((I've never seen such a beautiful sight))
((See love glowing on us every night))
((I know forever we'll be doing it))
[Chorus: Kenny Loggins, 
((Both))
]
((Sweet love's showing us a heavenly light))
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
((See love glowing on us every night))
I know forever we'll be doing it right
[Verse 3: 
(Stevie Nicks)
]
(Whenever I call you "friend")
(I believe I've come to understand)
(Everywhere we are)
(You and I were meant to be)
(Forever and ever)
[Verse 4: Kenny Loggins, 
((Both))
]
I think about the times to come
Knowing I will be the lucky one
And ever our love will last
I always want to call you 
((friend))
[Chorus: Kenny Loggins, 
((Both))
]
((Sweet love's showing us a heavenly light))
Never seen such a beautiful sight
((See love glowing on us every night))
((I know forever we'll be doing it))
