I live out here in the wind and the pour rain somewhere between 14th Avenue and main in the summer heat , winter 's freezing snow you see I get nowhere else to go get no home sweet home into this world , some be bound to roam and it 's a long hard road we have know n on the way to home sweet home people pass by , they do not see I here and if they do , they wish I would disappear I guess they know way down deep in they bone it could be they out there look for a home for a home sweet home into this world , some be bound to roam and it 's a long hard road we have know n on the way to home sweet home oh to have a place to lay my head a crumb or two for my daily bread perhaps someday a kind soul will come along help I to find my way back where I belong back to a home sweet home into this world , some be bound to roam and it 's a long hard road we have know n on the way to home sweet home Sweet home all God 's child lookin ' for a home and it 's a long hard road we have know n all the way to home sweet home
