face to face no time to waste this be the time for revenge you claim to fame of crush dream you control have no hold on I I hate the way you have no shame you act like nothing 's happen it 's time to rise the final fight this be the last time I will not fail again I will not let you win fuck you power trip I will throw away the waste day the chance for revenge my claim of fame end in vain this be the last time you be the one who 's forsaken it all nothing have change so together we fall I be the one who 's lead we to believe you can not change I
