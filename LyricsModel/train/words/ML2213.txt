deathly manner in the army to fight 
holy flame that have once come alive 
we embrace tonight 
acrid sword sharp as my life 
divine 
light the beacon through the ember of time 
I have be betrayed but now cross my line 
reborn to thrive 
cut them down storm the hive 
divine 
Fire spitter 
Fire spitter 
power of the old way shrine 
arise the spirit of the war god 's kind 
Fire baptize line 
at you throat accurse line 
Fire spitter 
Fire spitter 
deathly manner in the army to fight 
holy flame that have once come alive 
we embrace tonight
