good morning mister sunshine you brighten up my day 
come sit beside I in you way 
I see you every morning outside the restaurant 
the music play so nonchalant 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
good morning mister sunshine you brighten up my day 
come sit beside I in you way 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
yeah lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
Lonely day lonely night 
where would I be without my woman 
yeah lonely day lonely night
