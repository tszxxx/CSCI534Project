mind of chaos sorrow 
this within my blood 
life of sickness evil 
this within my blood 
can not see what lie ahead 
when moon be go and the son be dead 
can not fly with broken wing 
as darkness encompass all thing 
something inside of I have die 
or cease to exist 
I walk this earth alone 
evil demon rule my life 
evil inside torment my life 
evil inside 
control my life 
can not escape what be within my blood 
can not escape what be within my blood 
evil demon now control my life
