I see he all the time every night and every day 
I know we be do fine he call I I be on my way 
we never sit around we just go outside instead 
he steal my thunder while I pick the flower in he head 
all the time all the time all the time all the time 
we go commit a crime I see he all the time 
all the time all the time all the time all the time 
we go commit a crime I see he all the time 
I see he all the time every minute every hour 
we love be like a lime sometimes sweet but mostly sour 
we never fool around we just walk and talk instead 
he steal my thunder while I pick the flower in he head 
all the time all the time all the time all the time 
we go commit a crime we never wait in line 
but he always look so fine I see he all the time 
all the time all the time all the time all the time
