[Verse 1]
I can't understand a word your saying
We've got a bad connection on our minds
Communications one thing we never seem to find
Oh Lord I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line
All I get is static when we're talking
You say my line is out of order all the time
We have nothing left in common
Your thoughts are not like mine
Oh Lord I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line
There's trouble on the line
From your heart to mine
Oh Lord I'm sorry but we're not getting through
[Chorus]
The storm keeps getting worse
Lord, we might as well quit tryin
Oh Lord I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line
Oh Lord I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line
[Chorus]
