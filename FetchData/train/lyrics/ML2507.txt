[Verse 1]
Here I am again
I feel time is draggin' on
Aren't you getting tired of me?
Whinging overdrawn
[Chorus]
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
[Verse 2]
In a bodiless embrace
Thriving I have grown
Fickle, changing, grip replaced
Choking take it all
[Chorus]
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
[Verse 3]
Dedicated, true to form
Still the only one
Only guarantee
Continue after I am done
[Chorus]
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
