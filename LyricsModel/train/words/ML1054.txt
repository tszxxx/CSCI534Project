here I lie 
in a lost and lonely part of town 
hold in time 
in a world of tear I slowly drow 
goin home 
I just can not make it all alone 
I really should be hold you 
holding you 
love you love you 
tragedy 
when the feeling be go and you can not go on 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why 
it be hard to bear 
with no one to love you you be 
goin nowhere 
tragedy 
when you lose control and you get no soul 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why 
it be hard to bear 
with no one beside you you be 
goin nowhere 
night and day 
there be a burn down inside of I 
burn love 
with a yearning that will not let I be 
down I go 
and I just can not take it all alone 
I really should be hold you 
holding you 
love you love you 
tragedy 
when the feeling be go and you can not go on 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why 
it be hard to bear 
with no one to love you you be 
goin nowhere 
tragedy 
when you lose control and you get no soul 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why 
it be hard to bear 
with no one beside you you be 
goin nowhere 
Oooohh 
tragedy 
when the feeling be go and you can not go on 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why 
it be hard to bear 
with no one to love you you be 
goin nowhere 
tragedy 
when you lose control and you get no soul 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you heart just die 
it be hard to bear 
with no one beside you you be 
goin nowhere 
Aaahhhh 
tragedy 
when the feeling be go and you can not go on 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why 
it be hard to bear 
with no one to love you you be 
goin nowhere 
tragedy 
when you lose control and you get no soul 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you heart just die 
it be hard to bear 
with no one beside you you be 
goin nowhere 
Aaahhhh

when the feeling be go and you can not go on 
it be tragedy 
when the morning cry and you do not know why
