It’s raining so hard
Looks like it’s going
To rain all night
And this is the time
I’d love to be
Holding you tight
I guess I’ll have
To accept the fact
That you are not here
I wish tonight
Would hurry up and end
My dear
It’s raining so hard
It’s really coming down
Sittin’ by my window
Watchin’ the rain
Fall to the ground
This is the time
I’d love to be
Holding you tight
I guess I’ll just go
Crazy tonight
It’s raining so hard
Brings back memories
Of the times
When you were
Here with me
Counting every drop
About to blow my top
I wish this rain
Would hurry up
And stop
I’ve got the blues
So bad
I could hardly
Catch my breath
The harder it rains
The worst it get
This is the time
I’d love to be
Holding you tight
I guess
I’ll just go
Crazy tonight
It’s raining so hard
Brings back memories
Of the times
When you were
Here with me
This is the time
I’d love to be
Holding you tight
I guess
I’ll just go
Crazy tonight
