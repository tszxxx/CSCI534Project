I be so hurt 
to think that you lie to I 
I be hurt 
Way down deep inside I 
you say you love be true 
and we would never ever part 
now you want someone new 
and it break it break my heart 
I be so hurt 
much more than you will ever know 
yes darl I be so hurt 
because I still love you so 
but but even even though you hurt I 
like nobody else could ever do 
I would never ever hurt hurt you
