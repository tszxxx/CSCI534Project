Who am I that You are mindful of me
That You hear me when I call
Is it true that You are thinking of me
How You love me
It's amazing
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
He calls me friend
God Almighty, Lord of Glory
You have called me friend (Repeat)
You call me friend
You call me friend...
