I see he 
he see I 
that Turin stain shroud 
in Rimini 
he cry 
and I cry 
we both die 
laugh 
he and I 
why I 
why Rimini 
I want you 
you want I 
we both want 
the thing we will never be now 
we see now 
it be sad how 
some thing be not mean to be 
for we 
be just you and I 
it never happen when you want it to 
it never do what it be suppose to do 
it be never good enough to see I through 
see I through 
I love that shroud that you be in 
I love that you be mature 
I love that sweet sack you be in 
I love you saccharin 
I love that shroud that you be in 
I love that you from Turin 
I love that sweet sack you be in 
I love you saccharin 
it never happen when you want it to 
it never do what it be suppose to do 
it be never good enough to see I through 
see I through 
he see I 
I see he 
we both see 
beneath each other 
skin deep 
er than deep 
we both sleep 
to dream of what could be 
for I 
and sing hymn for he and I 
it never happen when you want it to 
it never do what it be suppose to do 
it be never good enough to see I through 
see I through 
I love that shroud that you be in 
I love that you be from Turin 
I love that sweet sack you be in 
I love you saccharin 
I love that shroud that you be in 
I love that you be mature 
I love that sweet sack you be in 
I love you saccharin
