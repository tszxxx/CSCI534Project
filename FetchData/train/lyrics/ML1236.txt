[Chorus][x2]
I dig love[x4]
Hm, I dig love in the morning
I dig love in the evening
I dig love and I want you to know I dig love
[Verse 1]
Small love, big love, I don't care
Love's all good love to me
Left love, right love, anywhere love
There's a rare love, come on and get it, it's free
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Bought love, short love, in any port
Love's always there to see
Make love, take love, but you should give love
And try to live love, come on that's where you should be
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Yes, I want you to know I dig love[X2]
To know I dig love
Yes, I do
I dig love [repeat and fade]
