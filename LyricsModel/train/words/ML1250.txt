Julie say John I be get nowhere 
I write this letter hope to get someplace soon 
I want to get up 
when I wake up 
but when I get up 
I fall down 
Julie wake up Julie tell the story 
you write the letter say you be go to 
get there someday 
gonna walk in the sun 
and the wind and the rain 
never look back again 
now you fall down 
you be fall down 
you fall down 
you fall down 
you be fall down 
you fall down 
you fall down 
Julie say something Julie say you be sorry 
you be go to get better you better not 
leave I here anyway 
I want to get up when you wake up 
but when I get up 
I fall down 
I be fall down 
I fall down 
I break myself 
I fall I fall down 
I be fall down 
I fall down 
when you fall 
I fall with you 
and when you be fall down 
be when I hit the ground 
I fall with you 
I fall down
