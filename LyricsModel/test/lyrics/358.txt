[Verse 1]
Whenever I dance with the girl I love
My head goes round and round
When she's close to me
I can't stay on the ground
Whenever I dance with the girl I love
I never have a care
All night I'm so light
I walk right on the air
[Chorus]
Oh let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you
[Verse 2]
Whenever I feel those pretty arms
Reaching round about
That feeling goes to my toes
And all the lights go out, go out, go out
Whenever I see those eyes of blue
Smiling up so shy
I'm in such a spin I take right off and fly
[Chorus]
So let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you
[Verse 3]
So let me dance in the arms I love
Thrill me through and through
I'm so drunk with love
That all I see is you
I never hear the music play
I never see the crowd
Only you and me
Dancing on a cloud
[Chorus]
Oh let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have, another dance, with you
