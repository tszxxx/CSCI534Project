Yo
If you don't know what the world means to me
Things change and rearrange
Friends aren't friends anymore
People go behind your back to score or anything
Will we ever have peace
Someone tell me please?
You know you will see on the block
Kids playing hearing gunshots
Never phased by the crimes that they witness
Follow me and come and see how it got this way
Young mama right there
Don't be cussing at your kids right there
Put the right foundation right here
(Teach respect)
So they can be
Most high (most high)
Most high (most high)
Most high (most high)
Like an angel in the sky
Most high
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Brother, why act?
Why you act that ?
(Why you acting that way?)
Call your girl "Woman"
Not her name
Bringing kids in the world unclaimed
You should know that don't make you a man at all
(Not at all)
Young father out there
(Listen up)
Don't abandon your seed out there
(Show we care)
Let's get one thing clear (for real)
Family should be
Most high (held high)
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Most high
(It's the most)
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
It doesn't matter where yu are
You're still a shining star
It doesn't matter where you're from
(It doesn't matter where you're from)
Let's give love to everyone
(Start showing more love)
Hustlers, put down your guns
(Put em down)
Self-respect is the best weapon
Spead love show your real value
Set a true example by starting with you
See them kids right there
Don't be shooting 'round them kids right there
Gotta show there is hope out here
Train yourself
You can be most high
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, oooh
Most high (most high)
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Most high (oooh, yeah, yeah)
Most high
Most high (most high)
Like an angel in the sky
It doesn't matter where you are
You're still a shining star
(Most high)
It doesn't matter where you're from
Let's give love to everyone
Most high (most high)
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Most high
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
