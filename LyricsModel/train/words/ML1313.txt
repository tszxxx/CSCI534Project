I can read the writing on the wall 
you pretend that nothing be change at all 
I have get just one thing to ask you if it be so 
just take you memory with you when you go 
so I will not have to think about 
the lonely night I will be without 
someone to hold I when the cold wind blow 
take you memory with you when you go 
I walk the floor and wonder what go wrong 
I will have to find a way to carry on 
why do not you leave before the heartache start to show 
take you memory with you when you go 
so I will not have to think about 
the lonely night I will be without 
someone to hold I when the cold wind blow 
take you memory with you 
so I will not have to miss you 
take you memory with you when you go
