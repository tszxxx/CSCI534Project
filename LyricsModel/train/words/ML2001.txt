we have get trouble 
something be just not right 
just this morning you cry about last night 
you say that something be bound to break this time 
what be break be my heart 
I can read between the line 
it be tear I apart 
you have get leave on you mind 
but you be my angel baby 
yes you be my angel baby 
wooh you be my angel baby 
for the rest of the night 
do you remember how it use to be 
loving be easier when you be love I 
I guess you find someone and now I find 
what be break be my heart 
you have get leave on you mind
