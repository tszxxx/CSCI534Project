when you be all alone 
all the child grow 
and like starling fly away 
it get lonely early do not it 
Lonely early do not it 
ev'ry single endless day 
when you twilight near 
and one face appear 
turn winter year to May 
it get lonely early do not it 
Lonely early do not it 
still the old heart be young enough to say 
it be really more than lovely be not it 
truly lovely be not it 
string 
Ev'ry single lovely day
