[Verse 1]
We can never go home
We no longer have one
I'll help you carry the load
I'll carry you in my arms
We walk through the ash
And the charred remains of our country
Keep an eye on my back
I'll keep an eye on the road
[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
[Verse 2]
If I say shut your eyes
If I say look away
Bury your face in my shoulder
Think of a birthday
The things you put in your head
They will stay there forever
I'm trying hard to hide your soul, son
From things it's not meant to see
[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
[Bridge]
If I say shut your eyes
If I say shut your eyes
Bury me in surprise
When I say shut your eyes, eyes
[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
