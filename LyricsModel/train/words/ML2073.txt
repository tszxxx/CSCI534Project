have you list all the time you have try 
do you call on all you alibis 
when somebody ask the question why be you hide 
do you feel the pull do you hear a call 
do you take a chance and lose it all 
do you fear there be no collateral leave for try 
friend I know you heart be raw 
but love be still a worthy cause 
pick up and press on 
oh love be still a worthy cause 
it be the touch that start the thaw 
love be still a worthy cause 
or the word that break the pause 
love 
it be the beauty in the tale we tell 
it be the push through and end well 
and find strength to give ourselves away 
in the midst of pass bravery 
in the face of we own injury 
it be the constant generosity of grace 
friend I know you heart be raw 
but love be still a worthy cause 
pick up and press on 
oh love be still a worthy cause 
it be the touch that start the thaw 
love be still a worthy cause 
or the word that break the pause 
love 
I love because he love I 
when I have nothing 
I love because he love I 
when I have nothing 
I love because he love I 
when I have nothing
