[Verse 1]
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
[Verse 2]
The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
[Verse 3]
The choir of children sing their song
They practised all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
[Verse 4]
The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
And don't look down
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
[Verse 3]
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
[Verse 2]
The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
[Verse 1]
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
