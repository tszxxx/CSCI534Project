I saw her today, I saw her face
Was the face I loved and I knew
I had to run away and get down on my knees and pray-ay
That they'd go away
But still they begin...
Needles and pins
Needles and pins
Needles and pins...
I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done...
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
[Short Instrumental Break]
Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies, lies, lies...
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose, oh...
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
Cryptic writings on the wall, the beginning of the end
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
[Instrumental Break]
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
In my hand, in my hand, in my hand...
