I was there when you
Shone as bright as
Bethlehem from afar
I was there when
You were young and strong and perverted
And everything that makes a young man a star
Oh you were a star
I was there and i swear to god
And on my mother's grave
On everything i have
Or ever will embrace
I was there
And i saw it with my own two eyes
And now it's all around me
It's all around me
I'm surrounded
Now it's all around me
It's all around me
You surround me like a circle
I was there
C'mon and tell me i wasn't worth
Sticking it out for
Well i was there
And i know i was worth it
Cause if i wasn't worth it
That makes me worse off then you are
And now it's all around me
It's all around me
I'm surrounded
Now it's all around me
It's all around me
You surround me like a circle
But don't you lose sight of me now
Don't lose you sight of me now
Cause i was there
When they dropped the bomb
Ya' know i remember the bomb
And i still hear the bomb
And i still fight the bomb
You know i still fear the bomb
You know i still hate the bomb
Sometimes i still get the call
So don't you lose sight of me now
Don't you lose sight of me now
You know you're all around me all around me
I'm surrounded (So don't you lose sight of me now)
You know you're all around me all around me
I'm surrounded (Don't you lose sight of me now)
You know you're all around me all around me
I'm surrounded (So don't you lose sight of me now)
You're all around me all around me all around me
I'm surrounded (Don't you lose sight of me now)
You surround me like a circle
