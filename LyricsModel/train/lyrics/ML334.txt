[Verse 1]
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now
[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
Somebody already broke my heart
[Verse 2]
Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind
[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again
[Verse 3]
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now
[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again
