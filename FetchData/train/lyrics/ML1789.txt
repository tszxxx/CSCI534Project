[Verse 1]
Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
You give a little more
Than you like
You pick apart the past
You're not going back
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Hook]
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a
[Verse 2]
Sure, you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
You give a little more
Than you like
Pick apart the past
You're not going back
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Hook]
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a
[Bridge]
Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I am blessed with a kingdom, half mine
[Hook]
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
