a day in the life of a fool 
a sad and a long lonely day 
I walk the avenue 
hope to run into 
the very sight of you come my way 
I stop just in front of we door 
but you be never there any more 
so back to my room 
and here in the gloom 
I cry tear of goodbye 
til you come back to I 
that be the way it will be 
everyday in the life of a fool
