you cheatin ' heart will make you weep you will cry and cry and try to sleep but sleep will not come the whole night through you cheatin ' heart will tell on you when tear come down like fall rain you will toss around and call my name you will walk the floor the way I do you cheatin ' heart will tell on you you cheatin ' heart will pine some day and crave the love you throw away the time will come when you will be blue you cheatin ' heart will tell on you when tear come down like fall rain you will toss around and call my name you will walk the floor the way I do you cheatin ' heart will tell on you Songwriter : Hank Williams sr
