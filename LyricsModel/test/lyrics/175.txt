(Dallas Frazier)
George Jones
Now if I was a monkey, a-workin' for a livin'
I'd be a-gettin' instead of a-givin'
A-hangin' by my tail, a-waitin' for the dinner bell
Puttin' humans on
Every day them fools rush in
And lay down the cash and watch me grin
I put 'em all on, I'd hum a little song
An' watch 'em all go tee-hee
But I spell a P, a little bitty E
Sweet bop, bop, bop, sh-shoo, shoobie doobie doh
In a little round O
Now you add another P, a big skinny L
There's a-one more E
An' you got a people that looks like, me
Now a monkey don't have to go down town
An' ask for a job an' gettin' turned down
I'm mad at me, I could smash me
'Cause I am a people
--- Instrumental ---
Now, a monkey don't have to shoot an' speak
All he do is scratch his fleas
Oh, me, what luxury
But I'm a people
Now I spell a P, a little bitty E
Sweet bop, bop, bop, a-shoo, shoobie doobie doh
In a little round O
Now you add another P, a big skinny L
There's a-one more E
An' you got a creature that looks like, me
Now if anyone knocked on my door today
There'd be a little sign says: Gone away
Down to the zoo, diggin' you know who
'Cause I'm a people
Now I spell a P, a little bitty E
Sweet bop, bop, bop, sh-shoo, shoobie doobie doh
In a little round O
Now you add another P, a big skinny L
There's a-one more E
An' you got a creature that looks like, me...
