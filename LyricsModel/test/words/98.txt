let I introduce myself I be a social disease I have come for you wealth leave you on you knee no time for feeling sorry I get here on my own I will not ask for mercy I choose to walk alone what 's yours be mine what 's mine be mine too if you shake my hand better count you finger what if I do get catch ? what if there be no judgement ? if I be right , I lose nothing if you be right , I lose it all I ought to get catch because I be do something wick I be guilty , haunt by my fear and the only consequence be dread and the fugitive mind you build wall to protect you so no - one will infect you pursue by those out there that vanish in thin air come a long way to find what you really leave behind you do not know when the end be but it 's come fast
