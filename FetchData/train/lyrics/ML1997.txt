Giddiup the guts and step on up
So we can sleigh ride

Cheeks so nice and rosey
Comfy cozy are we (Nice and cozy)

We're flyin in the sleigh
Home alone, Christmas Eve
Make-believe it's time to play
So let's flow on this snow with a sack on my back
Cause Santa's tryin to mack in his (Cadillac)
Ridin' and a ridin'
But when it gets to decidin'
He's a slippin' and a slidin' in his own sleigh ride
