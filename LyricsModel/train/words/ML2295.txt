seek out the darkness welcome wretchedness 
submerge in hatred blasphemy and death 
desire the fire become evil 's flame 
allegiance to the unlord kill and kill again 
within the darkness all be consume 
inclined to madness chaos and doom 
overflow evil bound by wickedness 
with unholy eye of the serpent void of righteousness 
dead be the world I live in evil be the air I breath 
where the light have fail darkness now prevail
