I don't wanna touch
I don't wanna see you
'Cause I don't miss you that much
I'm not a telephone junkie
I told you that we were just good friends
But when I hold you like I hold
That Bakelite in my hands
There's no action
There's no action
There's no action
And ev'ry time I phone you
I just wanna put you down
He's got the keys to the car
They are the keys to the kingdom
He's got ev'rything you need
It's a shame that he didn't bring them
I'm not a telephone junkie
If I'm inserting my coin I'm doing just fine
And the things in my head
Start hurtin' my mind
And I think about the way things used to be
Knowing you with him is driving me crazy
Sometimes I phone you when I know you're not lonely
But I always disconnect it in time
There's no action
There's no action
There's no action
And ev'ry time I phone you
I just wanna put you
And ev'ry time I phone you
I just wanna put you
And ev'ry time I phone you
I just wanna put you down
There's no action
There's no action
There's no action
Ev'ry time I phone you
I just wanna put you down
