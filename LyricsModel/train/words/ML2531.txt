we can not play this game anymore 
but can we still be friend 
thing just can not go on like before 
but can we still be friend 
we have something to learn 
now it be time for the wheel to turn 
grain of sand one by one 
before you know it all go 
let 's admit we make a mistake 
but can we still be friend 
Heartbreak be never easy to take 
but can we still be friend 
it be a strange sad affair 
sometimes seem like we just do not care 
do not waste time feeling hurt 
we have be through hell together 
La la lala la la lala la 
can we still be friend 
can we still get together sometime 
La la lala la la lala la 
can we still be friend 
you know life will still go on and on and on 
we aweak from we dream 
thing be not always what they seem 
memory linger on 
it be like a sweet sad old song
