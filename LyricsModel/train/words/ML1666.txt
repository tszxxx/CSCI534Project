sweet silver bell 
all seem to say 
throw care away 
Christmas be here 
bring good cheer 
to young and old 
Meek and the bold 
Ding dong ding dong 
that be they song 
with joyful ring 
all caroling 
one seem to hear 
word of good cheer 
from ev'rywhere 
fill the air 
oh how they pound 
raise the sound 
of 'er hill and dale 
tell they tale 
gaily they ring 
while people sing 
song of good cheer 
Christmas be here 
merry merry merry merry Christmas 
merry merry merry merry Christmas 
on on they send 
on without end 
they joyful tone 
to ev'ry home 
Ding dong ding dong
