I have have big dream come true and I believe in 
angel although I can not see they 
they be watch over everything I do 
ai not no easy street around the bend on my road 
no pot of gold at the end of my rainbow 
but I do not mind cause baby I get you 
the rain keep the flower from dyin 
the sun light the world when it shine 
the midnight sky have a blanket of star and a moon 
and baby I get you 
I can not imagine one day without you in it 
life alone just would not be worth livin 
love would be a wish that never come true 
Lord know I have get more than I deserve 
but I do not question the prayer that I have have ansered 
I do something right cause 
baby I get you 
the rain keep the flower from dyin 
the sun light the world when it shine 
the midnight sky have a blanket of star and a moon 
and baby I get you 
the rain keep the flower from dyin 
the sun light the world when it shine 
the midnight sky have a blanket of star and a moon 
and baby I get you
