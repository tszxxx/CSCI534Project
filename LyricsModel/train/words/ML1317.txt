every now and then when the world step in 
stealin all we time away 
it soon take so much we forget to touch 
that be when I know it be time for I to say 
take my hand let 's walk through love 's door 
and be free from the world once more 
here be my arm we can hide today 
and love the world away 
once again we will be where we heart be free 
and the time be ours to share 
love will always stay just a touch away 
come with I all the magic 's wait there 
take my hand let 's walk through love 's door 
and be free from the world once more 
here be my heart we can hide today 
and love the world away 
we can love the world away
