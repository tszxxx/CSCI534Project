the strangest thought come to I on this morning 
as I aweak to greet the come daw and 
the sun be hardly peak through the garden 
it feel that with everything I be one 
then I wish that I could come back as a flower 
as a flower 
as a flower 
how I wish that I could come back as a flower 
as a flower 
to spread the sweetness of love 
to spread the sweetness of love 
the dew have finish make love to many 
a rainbow smell sweet be in the air 
I envy all the silence I see grow 
so unmoved by thing outside of themselves 
then how I wish that I could come back as a flower 
as a flower 
as a flower 
how I wish that I could come back as a flower 
as a flower 
to spread the sweetness of love 
how I wish that I could come back as a flower 
oh as a flower 
as a flower 
how I wish that I could come back as a flower 
as a flower 
to spread the sweetness of love 
to spread the sweetness of love
