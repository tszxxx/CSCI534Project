one more young writer slid away in the night 
over the border he will drow in light 
hold it wait a minute 
I can not read my writing my own writing 
like tiny insect in the palm of history 
a domino effect in a cloud of mystery 
my writing be a iron fist 
in a glove full of vaseline 
but dip the fuse in the kerosene 
I too become a dissident 
court disaster we run in the night 
wing of a angel be tear in flight 
check it verify it 
it be all here in writing down in writing 
at the hand of the press 
and in the eye of the government 
I fall from grace 
I too become a dissident 
like tiny insect in the palm of history 
a domino effect and a early end to this story 
my writing be a iron fist 
in a glove full of vaseline 
but dip the fuse in the kerosene 
I too become a dissident
