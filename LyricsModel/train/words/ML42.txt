some people seem to think they always know what be best for you 
they little mind try to create a world to keep you still 
the bolt be throw the cage be lock you see this do not you lie 
at first you cry and then you hate those people steal you will 
do as you be tell 
and maybe then we will let you out 
you might be dead and cold 
you might be full of doubt 
do not try to escape 
cause you do not have nowhere to go 
if nothing be you fate 
there be no scenario 
do you call my name 
do you stain my brain 
my eye be blurry and I can not see you anymore 
do you call my name 
do you breed my pain 
my heart be bloody and I can not take it anymore 
so you just sit there stuck afraid to risk reality 
afraid to cause yourself more pain to face insanity 
but nothing venture nothing gain you see you fear 's you cage 
you beg for help but you be alone stuck in a helpless rage 
do as you be tell 
and maybe then we will let you out 
you might be dead and cold 
you might be full of doubt 
do not try to escape 
cause you do not have nowhere to go 
if nothing be you fate 
there be no scenario 
it be I 
I see 
please 
do as you be tell 
and maybe then we will let you out 
you might be dead and cold 
you might be full of doubt 
do not try to escape 
cause you do not have nowhere to go 
if nothing be you fate 
there be no scenario 
do you call my name 
do you stain my brain 
my eye be blurry and I can not see you anymore 
do you call my name 
do you breed my pain 
my heart be bloody and I can not take it anymore
