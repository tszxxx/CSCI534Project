brave in the clothes of Georgie 's 
you take a train to the North 
wind through New York state 
in the morning leave on the floor 
Gentle the rain at home 
Gentle the rain at home 
when we can and will return 
when we can and will return 
he say I could just take the canoe 
whenever I need 
and if I go back over the lake 
the cloud may recede 
Gentle the rain at home 
Gentle the rain at home 
when we can and will return 
when we can and will return
