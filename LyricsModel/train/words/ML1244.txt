I lose you 
you slip from you costume 
like a actress in this tragedy 
you be just a apparition in a haunting mystery 
I fear that you have pass over I 
and there be nothing I can do because 
I lose you 
just like a rich man who be careless of he change 
I take you for grant 
and then you go to stranger 
from deep within my heart I feel a distant fading pulse 
a poor woman look for last coin in she purse 
just like a counterfeit you pass from palm to palm 
I chase the one I surely love to someone else 's arm 
I mislaid my sense now that be easy to say 
a fool who take he pleasure but then throw he love away
