tell I just what happen 
let I get this down 
but I would better hear the same thing 
when I ask around 
no one be call you a liar but 
there be no smoke without fire 
the alibi you sell I 
you know it be not water tight 
a little birdie tell I 
and I get you dead to right 
no one be call you a liar but 
there be no smoke without fire 
darl please believe I 
Cross my heart you say 
but when I turn around 
you have you finger cross instead 
no one be call you a liar but 
there be no smoke without fire 
now I be a one man jury 
I get all the fact 
do you want to change you story 
before the judge get back 
no one be call you a liar but 
there be no smoke without fire
