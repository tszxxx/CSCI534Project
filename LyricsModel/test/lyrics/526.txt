[Verse 1]
I think I was wrong
I think you were right
That all my angry words
Will keep me up at night
And through the old screen door
I still hear you say
Oh, Honey won't you stop
Treating me that way
[Chorus]
If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
Cause babe I've changed
[Verse 2]
Tell it to me slow
Tell me with your eyes
If anyone should know
How to let it slide
I swear I can see you
Coming up the drive
And there ain't nothing like regret
To remind you you're alive
[Chorus]
If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
Cause babe I've changed
[Verse 3]
I crossed the canyon a thousand times
But never noticed what was mine
What you'll remember of me tonight
Well, it almost makes me cry
Yeah, it almost makes me cry
Oh ball breaking moon and ridiculing stars
The older I get, the closer you are
Don't you have somewhere that you need to be
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me
[Chorus][x2]
If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
Cause babe I've changed
If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
Cause babe I've changed
