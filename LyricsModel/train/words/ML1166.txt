Said farewell to my last hotel it never be much kind of abode 
Glasgow town never bring I down when I be head out on the road 
Carlisle city never look so pretty and the Kendal freeway be fast 
slow down driver want to stay alive I want to make this journey last 
Helen 
Hell on wheel 
be not nobody else go to know the way she feel 
Helen 
Hell on wheel 
and they be never go to take she away 
M6 south down Liverpool where they play the west coast sound 
Sailor Sam he come from Birmingham but he never will be find 
doin fine when a london sign greet I like a long lose friend 
Mister motor will not you check she out she be get to take I back again 
Helen 
Hell on wheel 
be not nobody else go to know the way she feel 
Helen 
Hell on wheel 
and they be never go to take she away 
get no time for a rum and lime I want to get my right foot down 
shake some dust off of this old bus I get to get she out of town 
spend the day upon the motorway where the carburetor blast 
slow down driver want to stay alive I want to make this journey last 
Helen 
Hell on wheel 
be not nobody else go to know the way she feel 
Helen 
Hell on wheel 
and they be never go to take she away 
say bye bye 
bye bye
