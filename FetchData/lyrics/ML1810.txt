[Verse 1]
The coal, the coal light
The callus, the caress
The comb, the calm
The colours, the cortex
The code, the codeine
The comma, the context
The collector, the green
The fine, the fall
The financier, the dream
The fen, the fine
The fin, the defend
The fawn, then do
[Verse 2]
The coal, the coal light
The colours, the caress
The comb, the calm
The colours, the cortex
The code, the codeine
The comma, the context
The corpse, the likeness
[Outro]
Die, cut, die, cut
Die, cut, die, cut
Die, cut, die, cut
Die
