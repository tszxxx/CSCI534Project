I take you home from a party and we kiss and burn 
a few steal kiss and no harm be do 
instead of stop when we could we go right on 
til suddenly we find that the brake be go 
oh you belong to someone else and I do too 
it be just crazy bein here with you 
like a bad motorcycyle with the devil in the seat 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
I do not want to want you but now I have no choice 
to late to listen to that whining voice 
all I hear be thunder when two heart beat 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
oh you be not free to belong to I 
and you know that I could never be you own 
but you lip on mine 
oh the sweet sweet wine 
what be we go to do 
warning sign be flash everywhere we pay no heed 
instead of slow down the pace we be pick up speed 
disaster be get closer everytime we meet 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
goin ninety mile a hour down a dead end street 
disaster be get closer every time we meet
