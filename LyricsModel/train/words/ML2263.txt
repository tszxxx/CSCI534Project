I be a man who walk alone 
and when I be walk a dark road 
at night or strol through the park 
when the light begin to change 
I sometimes feel a little strange 
a little anxious when it be dark 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have a constant fear that something be always near 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone be always there 
have you run you finger down the wall 
and have you feel you neck skin crawl 
when you be search for the light 
sometimes when you be scared to take a look 
at the corner of the room 
you have sense that something be watch you 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have constant fear that something be always near 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone be always there 
have you ever be alone at night 
think you hear footstep behind 
and turn around and no one be there 
and as you quicken up you pace 
you find it hard to look again 
because you be sure there be someone there 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have constant fear that something be always near 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone be always there 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
fear of the dark 
watch horror film the night before 
debate witch and folklore 
the unknown trouble on you mind 
maybe you mind be play trick 
you sense and suddenly eye fix 
on dancing shadow from behind 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have constant fear that something be always near 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone be always there 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have constant fear that something be always near 
fear of the dark fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone be always there 
when I be walk a dark road 
I be a man who walk alone
