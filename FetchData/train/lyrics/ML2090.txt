Walking a fine line between wrong and right, and I know
There is a part of me that I try to hide
But I can't win, and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
Now I am calling, hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something
And I won't fear this when I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones
Caught in the confines of the simple life, and I am
Holding my head high in the rising tide
And I can't win, and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
Now I am calling, hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something
And I won't fear this when I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones
I'm not coming home now, I know
I'm so far away, so far from home
I'm not coming home now, I know
I'm so far away, I'm so far away
And I can't win, and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Now I am calling, hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something
And I won't fear this when I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones
And I can't win, and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
And I can't win, and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
