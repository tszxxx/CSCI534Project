There's some things I forget
And if it's wrong, I keep it in check
'Cause what could I do?
If we go out tonight
With that blood on your shirt
Would it taste like a brand new shirt?
'Cause I don't know
Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give back pain
Show me how to fight, throw him down
There were times in the past
If I had the nerve, I couldn't make it last
Courage wasted in the night
And is it really so hard?
Tell your body to forget the words
Pushing you to run
'Cause I don't know
Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give back pain
Show me how to fight, throw him down
