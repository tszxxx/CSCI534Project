watch out 
you might get what you be after 
cool baby 
strange but not a stranger 
I be on or-din- a- ry- guy 
burn down the house 
hold tight 
wait till the party over 
hold tight 
we be in for nasty weather 
there have get to- be- a-way 
burn down the house 
here be you ticket pack you bag 
time for jumpin overboard 
transportation be here 
close enough but not too far 
maybe you know where you be 
fightin 's fire with fire 
all wet 
hey you might need a raincoat 
shakedown 
dream walk in broad daylight 
Three-hun- dred-six-ty-five- de- gree 
burn down the house 
it be once upon a place 
sometimes I listen to myself 
gonna come in first place 
people on they way to work 
say baby what do you expect 
gonna burst into flame 
burn down the house 
my house 
be out of the ordinary 
that be right 
do not want to hurt nobody 
some-things- sure-can- knock-me- off my- foot 
burn down the house 
no visible means of support and you have not see nothin yet 
everything be stick together 
I do not know what you expect stare into the tv set 
fight fire with fire
