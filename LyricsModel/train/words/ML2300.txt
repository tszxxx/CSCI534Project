stranger in my back yard 
sell you belief 
danger in my empire 
trouble on the street 
and I do not want to modernize 
and I do not want to rearrange 
I do not want to fix up 
and I do not want to change 
hold on to the thing that you love 
hold on to the thing that you love 
hold on 
danger in the papers 
danger in the magazine 
sell you idea 
sell you false dream 
and I do not want to modernize 
and I do not want to rearrange 
I do not want to fix up 
and I do not want to change 
hold on to the thing you can feel 
hold on to the thing that be real 
hold on
