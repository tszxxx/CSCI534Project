[Verse]
I love you I'll prove it in days to come
I swear it's true darling you're the only one
I've been so blue and lonesome since you've gone
I love you I'll prove it a thousand ways
I'll be nice and sweet to you and no more will you be blue
I'll prove I love you every day all kinds of ways
So darling please wait please wait until I'm free
There'll be a change a great change made in me
I love you and there'll never be blue days
I love you and I'll prove it a thousand ways
[piano]
I'll be nice and sweet to you
