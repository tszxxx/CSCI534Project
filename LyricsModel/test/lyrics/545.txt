[Verse 1]
The way she moves her hips up to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really moves the grass around
[Chorus]
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
[Verse 2x]
Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance
[Chorus ]
Oh that Rock-a-hula baby of mine
