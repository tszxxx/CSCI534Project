Said you would always feel like 
then everything just change in the blink of a eye 
and I could never leave like 
there be anything leave to leave behind 
you be right there and I be lonely 
and I could let you dow and 
someday you will say 
there be always be a part of I 
feeling like my heart be so far away 
search for a part of I 
look for somebody to blame 
Said you would always be around 
then you leave it all out on the line 
I would tear it all down 
just to watch you change what you know be right 
you be right there and I be lonely 
and I could let you dow and 
someday you will say 
there be always be a part of I 
feeling like my heart be so far away 
search for a part of I 
look for somebody to blame 
I need you to hear 
everything I want to say 
someday you will say 
there be always be a part of I 
feeling like my heart be so far away 
search for a part of I 
look for somebody to blame 
somebody to blame 
search for a part of I 
look for somebody to blame
