over the range 
the secret be what we become 
but only the secret remain 
do not settle on I now 
the cover be blow with a touch 
we go when they be ask too much 
get a history and it be catch up 
cross the nation like a roll blackout 
get the mystery but it be not enough 
be not a prison but you will never get out 
realise 
stay over be you only prize 
now I know 
some forget 
but I do not 
the road before we 
we move on and never let out 
the thing we have whisper about 
back to the mirror now 
there be nobody leave to defend 
it be here that my loyalty end 
get a history and it be catch up 
cross the nation like a roll blackout 
get the mystery but it be not enough 
be not a prison but you will never get out 
realise 
stay over be you only prize 
now I know 
some forgive 
but I do not 
no delay 
get out today 
get out if only I could 
let go 
I could say no 
but I will not
