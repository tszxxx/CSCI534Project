Intoxicated world, boys and girls
Fill me up, but not the hint of self mutilation
And let me blow my brains, go insane
Throw it in my face, and watch me chase it
Stimulate, wide awake, need to stop this pain inside my head, cause it's laughing at me
Injection, explosion, burning as it surges through my vein
Cause I, I'm Addicted
To all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
And you have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, love you when I know
Your wrong
Over and over-indulges in anyone or anything that makes you feel so alive
I am electrified, I'm so high, known to all of you, who are just out to get me
Fascinate, magic state, cast a spell and maybe I might forget who I am
Cowardice, selfishness, thank you for letting us watch you die
Because I, I'm Addicted
To all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
And you have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, love you when I know
That I, I'm Addicted
To all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, I love you when I know
Your wrong
Liar! You are a liar!
Liar! You are a liar!
Because I, I'm Addicted
To all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
And you have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, love you when I know
That I, I'm Addicted
To all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, I love you when I know
Your wrong
