I be dream of the past 
and my heart be beat fast 
I begin to lose control 
I begin to lose control 
I do not mean to hurt you 
I be sorry that I make you cry 
I do not mean to hurt you 
I be just a jealous guy 
I be feel insecure 
you might not love I anymore 
I be shiver inside 
I be shiver inside 
I do not mean to hurt you 
I be sorry that I make you cry 
I do not want to hurt you 
I be just a jealous guy 
I be try to catch you eye 
I think that you be try to hide 
I be swallow my pain 
I be swallow my pain 
I do not mean to hurt you 
I be sorry that I make you cry 
I do not mean to hurt you 
I be just a jealous guy
