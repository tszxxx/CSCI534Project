[Verse 1]
Do you want to be a poet and write?
Do you want to be an actor up in lights?
Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love?
Do you want to travel the world?
Do you wanna be a diver for pearls?
Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above?
[Pre-Chorus]
Be anyone you want to be
Bring to life your fantasies
I want something in return
[Chorus]
I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Burn
Burn for me, burn for me
[Verse 2]
Are you gonna to be a gambler and deal?
Are you gonna to be a doctor and heal?
Or go to heaven and touch God's face?
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps?
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps?
Or an angel under grace?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll lay down on your bed of coals
Offer up my heart and soul
But in return
[Chorus]
I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Burn
Burn for me, burn for me
[Bridge]
Ohh
I want you to burn, baby
Ohh
Laugh for me
Cry for me
Pray for me
Fly for me
Live for me
Die for us
[Chorus]
I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Oh, burn
Burn for me, burn for me
[Outro]
I want you to burn
I want you to burn, for me, baby
Burn for me
I want you to burn
I want you to burn, for me, baby
