what will you say when the day come 
when it be no fun 
when it be all do 
when it be no fun 
what will you say when the time come 
there be a dry run when it be undone 
and there be no one 
when it be too much love 
too much love 
too much 
it be too much love 
too much love 
too much 
what will you do when you wake up 
fatten you up 
fasten you up 
fatten you up 
no memory to get cloudy 
to get cloudy when you can not see 
what you can not see 
it be all the same when it be morning 
and you be boring 
still ignore everything 
no memory to remind you 
of the old you 
nothing for it 
just keep it up keep it up 
with no memory 
with no memory 
with no memory 
to keep you up at night
