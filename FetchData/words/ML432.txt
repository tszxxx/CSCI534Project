I would like to see you in the morning light I would like to feel you when it come tonight now I be here and I be all alone still I know how it feel I be alone again try so hard to make you see but I could not find the word now the tear , they fall like rain I be alone again without you Alone again without you Alone again without you Alone again without you I say stay , but you turn away try to say that it be I now I be here and I have lose my way now I know how it feel I be alone again repeat CHORUS I ... repeat CHORUS
