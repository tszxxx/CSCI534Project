you have get you strangler and prowler in soft shoe 
Furniture maker and carpenter too 
bomber and commando all with some lose cause 
disgruntled worker immerse in verit 
but stealthily in the land of the free 
it be lurk right there most be unaware of 
the biggest killer in american history 
the biggest killer in american history 
the biggest killer in american history 
the biggest killer in american history 
and God shed he grace on thee 
business institution university 
both be quite the circus when the killer want he way 
I think of Edward Teller and he moribund reprise 
then I look to Nevada and I can not believe my eye 
it be time for he to die 
most can not remember minutia learn in school 
it be not there on the blackboard it be what they do not tell you 
we have get a problem it start and end right here 
it can be defeat but you have get to face you fear 
we will join and unite and steady we sight 
then we will put it right cause it be time to fight
