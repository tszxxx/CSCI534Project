[Verse 1]
When Johnny comes marchin' home again, hurrah, tala
He's comin' by bus or underground, hurrah, tala
A woman's eye will shed a tear
To see his face so beaten in fear
And it was just around the corner in the English Civil War
[Verse 2]
It was still at the stage of clubs and fists, hurrah, tala
When that well known face got beaten to bits, hurrah, tala
Your face was blue in the light of the screen
As watched the speech of an animal scream
New Party army
 was marchin' right over our heads
[Bridge]
All right!
[Pre-Chorus]
Ha, ha, I told you so, hurrah, tala
Says everybody that we know, hurrah, tala
But who hid a radio under the stairs?
Who got caught out unawares?
New Party army came marchin' right up the stairs
[Chorus]
When Johnny comes marchin' home again, hurrah, tala
Nobody understands it can happen again, hurrah, tala
The sun is shinin' and the kids are shoutin' loud
Ya' got to know it's shinin' through a crack in the cloud
And the shadows keep on fallin', when Johnny comes marchin' home
[Outro]
Hurrah, Johnny
Oh yeah, Johnny
Oh, the guns come home
(?) comin' home
