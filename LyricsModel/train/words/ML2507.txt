here I be again 
I feel time be draggin on 
be not you get tired of I 
whing overdrawn 
faceless blind 
want to take she out again 
she be not just mine 
want to take she out again 
in a bodiless embrace 
thriving I have grow 
fickle change grip replace 
choke take it all 
faceless blind 
want to take she out again 
she be not just mine 
want to take she out again 
dedicate true to form 
still the only one 
only guarantee 
continue after I be do 
faceless blind 
want to take she out again 
she be not just mine 
want to take she out again
