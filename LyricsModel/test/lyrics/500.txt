life is boring me to tears after all
these years.
No sunshine. no moonlight. no star
dust. no sign of romance. we don't
stand a chance.
I always dreamed i'd find the
perfect lover, but he'd turned out
to be like every other man. our
love. our love.
Raining, raining. pouring, pouring.
there's nothing left for us here
and we won't waste another tear.
If you've had enough, don't put up
with his stuff, don't you do it.
Now if you've had your fill, get the
check, pay the bill, you can do it.
Tell him to just get out. nothing
left to talk about. pack his
raincoat and show him out. just
look him in the eye and simply
shout.
enough is enough. i can't go on, i
can't go on no more no. enough is
enough. i want him out, i want him
out that door now.
enough is enough. oooh oooh oooh.
oh. enough is enough. that's
enough. oooh oooh oooh. yeah.
If you've reached the end, don't
pretend that it's right when it's
over.
It's over. if the feeling is gone,
don't think twice, just move on,
get it over. over, over.
Tell him to just get out. say it
clearly, spell it out.
enough is enough is enough. i can't
go on, i can't go on no more no.
enough is enough is enough. i want
him out, i want him out that door
now.
enough is enough. oooh oooh oooh.
oh. enough is enough. that's
enough. oooh oooh oooh.
I always dreamed i'd find the
perfect lover, but he'd turned out
to be like every other man. our
love. our love. i've had no choice
from the start. our love. our love.
i've got to listen to my heart. our
love. our love. tearin' us apart.
our love.
enough is enough is enough. i can't
go on, i can't go on no more no.
enough is enough is enough. i want
him out, i want him out that door
now.
enough is enough. oooh oooh oooh.
oh. enough is enough. that's
enough. oooh oooh oooh. yeah.
No more tears. no more tears. no
more tears. no more tears. no more
tears. no more tears. no more tears.
no more tears.
Enough is enough is enough is enough
is enough is enough. i've had it.
i've had it. you've had it. he's had
it. we've had it. he's had it. you've
had it. i've had it. i've had it.
you've had it. we've had it. enough
is enough.
I always dreamed i'd find the
perfect lover, but he'd turned out
to be like every other man. our
love. our love. i've had no choice
from the start. our love. our love.
listen to me, i've got to listen to
my heart. our love. our love. tearin'
us apart.
enough is enough is enough. i can't
go on, i can't go on no more no.
enough is enough is enough. i want
him out, i want him out that door
now.
Good-bye, mister. good-bye, good-bye,
mister. good-bye, sugar.
It's raining. it's pouring. there's
nothing left for us here and we won't
waste another tear.
Enough is enough is enough is enough
is enough is enough is enough is
enough, that's enough. no more tears.
enough is enough is enough is enough
is enough is enough is enough is
enough is enough!
