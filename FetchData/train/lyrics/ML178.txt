[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
[Verse 1]
Black man got a lotta problems
But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be real thick
[Bridge]
Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
[Verse 2]
All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it
[Bridge]
Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
[Verse 3]
Are ya' takin' over
Or are ya' takin' orders?
Are ya' goin' backwards
Or are ya' goin' forwards?
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
