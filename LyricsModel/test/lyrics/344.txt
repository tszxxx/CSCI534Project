[Intro]
I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So, let me go, and just listen
[Verse 1]
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, "Little girl, don’t step into the club"
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah
[B-Section]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah (
Do you like it?
)
Get it, get it, get it, get it
(
This feels good
)
[Verse 2]
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical?
What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there
[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it
[Refrain]
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
(
I just wanna dance next to you
)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
(
Are you ready?
)
Leaving behind my name and age
[Break]
Let's go
Like that
You like it?
Yeah, now watch me
[B-Section]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah (
Do you like it?
)
Get it, get it, get it, get it
(
This feels good
)
[Bridge]
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(
I just can’t help myself
)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(
I just feel I let myself go
)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(
Wanna see you move
)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(
Uh, uh, uh
)
[Refrain]
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
(
I just wanna dance next to you
)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
(
Are you ready?
)
Leaving behind my name and age
[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it
[B-Section]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it
[Outro]
Like that
