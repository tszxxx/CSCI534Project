[Verse 1]
God, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man
[Verse 2]
Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
'Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?
[Chorus]
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave, don't leave
[Verse 3]
I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
Just try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man
[Bridge]
(Are you strong enough)
To be my man?
(Are you strong enough)
To be my man?
(Are you strong enough?)
My man
[Verse 4]
When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Would you be man enough to be my man?
[Outro]
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave
