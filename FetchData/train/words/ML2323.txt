even when the world be grey I go where I want to go , I be ok Rainy sky do not cloud my mind I do what I want to do , do what I want to do I do not know anything but I say what I want to say , say what I want to say know that I want you the sky in my mind be always blue in my world the sun shine from you often I know I do not see the wave of love that wash over I you love be a paradigm for a man just look for the next cheap rhyme visualize paradise be a thing I do not want to do , a thing I do not want to do but I know that I want you the sky in my mind be always blue in my world the sun shine from you Life trace the line in space between what 's go and what 's go to be time chase I , my mind race to find the place where I want to be the sky in my mind be always blue in my world the sun shine from you know that I want you know that I want you
