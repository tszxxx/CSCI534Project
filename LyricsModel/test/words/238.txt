Day by day , we let love just walk away and I will be the first to say , I be glad to see it go and day by day , ever since you go away I find that I be still miss you , and I have just get to know do that blue moon ever shine on you I want to hold you close to I , feel just like it use to be and baby , if you feel like I do you can come to I do that blue moon ever shine on you on my mind , you be right there all the time I could search and never find someone that do I like you do here be the part where I be give you my heart I be a fool to let you go , girl , I have just get to know do that blue moon ever shine on you I want to hold you close to I , feel just like it use to be and baby , if you feel like I do you can come to I do that blue moon ever shine on you night after night , I look to the star wonder where you might be and I have think to myself , be that very same moon Shining on you , like it be shine on I do that blue moon ever shine on you I want to hold you close to I , feel just like it use to be and baby , if you feel like I do you can come to I do that blue moon ever shine on you
