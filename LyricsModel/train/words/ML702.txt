I do not care where I go 
when I be with you 
when I cry you do not laugh 
because you know I 
I be in you you be in I 
I be in you you be in I 
because you give I the love 
love that I never have 
yes you give I the love 
love that I never have 
you and I do not pretend 
we make love 
I can not feel any more 
than I be sing yeah 
come so far when you think 
of last fall 
you can not buy what we make 
you and I oh 
you give I the love 
love that I never have 
I do not care where I go 
when I be with you
