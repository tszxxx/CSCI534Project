hey baby boy be you mama home 
do she go away and leave you all alone 
I get a bad desire 
oh oh- ohh I be on fire 
tell I now baby be she good to you 
do she do to you thing that I do 
I be go to take you higher 
oh oh- ohh I be on fire 
sometimes it be like someone take a knife baby edgy and dull 
and cut a six inch valley through the middle of my soul 
at night I wake up with the sheet soak wet 
and a freight train run through the middle of my head 
only you can cool my desire

oh oh- ohh I be on fire 
yeah I be on fire 
oh oh- ohh I be on fire 
ohh oh- oh I be on fire
