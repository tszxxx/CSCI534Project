Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby
Oh, I love you so
[Verse 1]
Sixteen candles
Make a lovely light
But not as bright as your eyes tonight
[Verse 2]
Blow out the candles
Make your wish come true
For I'll be wishing
That you love me, too
[Bridge]
You're only sixteen
But you're my teenage queen
You're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen
[Verse 3]
Sixteen candles
In my heart will glow
For ever and ever for I love you so
[Bridge]
You're only sixteen
But you're my teenage queen
Oh, you're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen
[Verse 4]
Sixteen candles
In my heart will glow
For ever and ever
For I love you so
For I love you so!!!
