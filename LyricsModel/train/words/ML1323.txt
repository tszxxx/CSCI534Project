you can dance 
every dance with the guy 
who give you the eye 
let he hold you tight 
you can smile 
every smile for the man 
who hold you hand 
Neath the pale moonlight 
but do not forget who be take you home 
and in whose arm you be go to be 
so darlin 
save the last dance for I mmm 
oh I know 
that the music be fine 
like sparkle wine 
go and have you fun 
laugh and sing 
but while we be apart 
do not give you heart 
to anyone 
but do not forget who be take you home 
and in whose arm you be go to be 
so darlin 
save the last dance for I mmm 
baby do not you know I love you so 
can not you feel it when we touch 
I will never never let you go 
I love you oh so much 
you can dance 
go and carry on 
till the night be go 
and it be time to go 
if he ask 
if you be all alone 
can he take you home 
you must tell he no 
cause do not forget who be take you home 
and in whose arm you be go to be 
so darlin 
save the last dance for I 
cause do not forget who be take you home 
and in whose arm you be go to be 
so darlin 
save the last dance for I mmm 
save the last dance for I mmm 
save the last dance for I
