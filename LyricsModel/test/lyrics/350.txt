[Verse 1]
Good is good and bad is bad
But you don't know which one you had
She put your books out on the sidewalk
Now they're blowin' 'round
They won't help you when you're down
[Verse 2]
Love's on your list of things to do
To bring your good luck back to you
And if you think that everything's unfair
Would you care if you're the last one standing there
[Chorus]
And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightning strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by
[Verse 3]
I don't hold no mystery
But I can show you how to turn the key
'Cause all I know is where I started
Is so downhearted, that's not where you want to be
[Chorus]
And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightning strikes
And you could find a rock to crawl right under
And let your good times pass you by
[Bridge]
When the day is done
And the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine
All your friends are gone
You thought were so worth keeping
You feel you don't belong
And you don't know why, oh
[Chorus]
And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightning strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by
Every time you hear the rolling thunder
And you turn around before the lightning strikes
Well does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by
[Outro]
When the day is done
And the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine, shine
And all your friends are gone
You thought were so worth keeping
You feel you don't belong
Neither do I
