[Verse 1]
Born from the fire clean
Crawling in the dirt like war
5 years
My mother gave a voice for war
10, I was dead
Born again with eyes for war
By 15
Hate was the name of my war
[Hook]
Wash me in the river
Give me to the pain of LifeWar
LifeWar
[Verse 2]
20 years gone
And father told me life was like war
Hands to the bone
25 years of war
30
I wake to the sound of souls at war
I will pass through
Buried with the flag of my war
[Hook]
Wash me in the river
Give me to the pain of LifeWar
LifeWar (x5)
