the open wound I cut , now fester and succumb to insect infestation , bacterial infiltration on a micro biotic level , they grow and overtake a human piece of waste , a experiment of decay God of the fly , release you seed of filth to grow and conquer , on death , on myself Maggots , maggot ! on my corpse Feeding , seep , pus do flow Rotten body the maggot feed and grow , the maggot feed and grow !
