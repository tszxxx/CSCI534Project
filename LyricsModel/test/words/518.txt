I do not know how to live through this hell Woken up , I be still lock in this shell Frozen soul , freeze down to the core break the ice , I can not take anymore freezing , can not move at all scream , can not hear my call I be die to live cry out , I be trap under ice Crystallized as I lay here and rest eye of glass stare directly at death from deep sleep , I have break away no one know , no one hear what I say freezing , can not move at all scream , can not hear my call I be die to live cry out , I be trap under ice scream from my soul fate , mystify Hell , forever more scream from my soul fate , mystify Hell , forever more no release from my cryonic state what be this ? I have be stricken by fate wrap up tight , can not move , can not break free Hand of doom have a tight grip on I freezing , can not move at all scream , can not hear my call I be die to live cry out , I be trap under ice freezing , can not move at all scream , can not hear my call I be die to live cry out , I be trap under ice
