in this world of ordinary people 
extraordinary people 
I be glad there be you 
in this world of over- rate treasure 
of under-rated pleasure 
I be so glad there be you 
I live to love 
I love to live with you be beside I 
this role so new 
I will muddle through with you to guide I 
so in this world where many many play at love 
and hardly any stay in love 
I be glad there be you more than ever 
I be glad there be you 
I live to love 
I love to live with you beside I 
this role so new 
I will muddle through with you to guide I 
so in this world in this world in this world 
where many many play at love 
but hardly any stay in love 
I be glad there be you more than ever 
I be glad there be you
