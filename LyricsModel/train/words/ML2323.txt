even when the world be grey 
I go where I want to go I be ok 
rainy sky do not cloud my mind 
I do what I want to do do what I want to do 
I do not know anything but I 
say what I want to say say what I want to say 
know that I want you 
the sky in my mind be always blue 
in my world the sun shine from you 
often I know I do not see 
the wafe of love that wash over I 
you love be a paradigm 
for a man just look for the next cheap rhyme 
visualize paradise be a 
thing I do not want to do a thing I do not want to do 
but I know that I want you 
the sky in my mind be always blue 
in my world the sun shine from you 
life trace the line in space between 
what be go and what be go to be 
time chase I my mind race 
to find the place where I want to be 
the sky in my mind be always blue 
in my world the sun shine from you 
know that I want you 
know that I want you
