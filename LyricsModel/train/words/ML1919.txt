I want to be a kid again 
comb down hair and Sunday best 
see I stay out bunk school 
know wrong from right just rule 
I wish I would never see you face 
better door than window phase 
I need a echo not you praise 
stray from the point you nail 
my mother my mother my mother never tell 
my mother my mother my mother never tell I 
love be just a 
bloodsport 
love be just a bloodsport 
cause love be just a bloodsport 
love be just a bloodsport 
sex and love be not a game 
a game be something you can win 
maybe something kind of fun 
cause love be just a bloodsport so and 
my mother my mother my mother never tell 
my mother my mother my mother never tell I 
never tell I 
never tell I 
cause love be just a bloodsport 
love be just a bloodsport 
cause love be just a bloodsport 
love be just a bloodsport 
cause love be just a bloodsport 
love be just a bloodsport 
cause love be just a bloodsport 
love be just a bloodsport
