down the stair to the stone house 
golden light oh what a fight 
another sleepless night she dress be filigree 
she tell I all she secret then I be back on the street 
it be hard oh it be hard to help yourself 
when you do not know where to begin 
it be the devil it be the boil it be the black of night 
in you head in you head 
do you see the fire heavy light before it be time 
know you the color of the end of the end of the end 
silence be dance to a beating drum 
money be nothing but a load gun 
and it be hard oh it be hard to help yourself 
when you do not know where to begin 
it be the devil it be the boil it be the black of night 
in you head in you head 
it be hard oh it be hard to help yourself 
when you do not know where to begin 
it be the devil it be the boil it be the black of night 
in you head in you head 
and it be hard oh it be hard to help yourself 
when you do not know where to begin 
in the midst of a moment can you break the bull 
can you tame the demon 
light a candle in the dark in the dark in dark 
in the dark light a candle in the dark in dark 
in dark in dark oh in the dark light a candle in the dark 
in dark in dark in dark
