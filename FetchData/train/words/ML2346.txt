you get to come back to I I can not bare to spend my life alone just wait on you ghost and live without you I be afraid that would not do you have to believe I I can not spend one night alone without you breath in my ear I be empty without it and I be afraid I could not live maybe there 's a chance that I could carry on with you memory maybe there 's a hope that I could live in the shell you leave of I maybe I could last a while as the poster child for tragedy I be afraid that could not be the silence be deafen must I face another day without the rhythm of you voice that echoe inside I it 's a song I will never sing Chorus it 's a thing I could not do it 's a thing I could not do it 's a thing I could not do I afraid that could not be Chorus I can not bear to spend my life I can not bear to spend this life I can not bear to spend my life alone
