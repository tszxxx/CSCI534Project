[
Chorus
]
I'm going to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I'm going to love you night and day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
[Verse]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show it and you're driving me back
Your love for me has got to be real
For you to know just how I feel
Love is real and not fade away
Well love is real and not fade away
[Chorus]
I'm going to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I'm going to love you night and day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
