[Instrumental Intro]
Enter the arena and hit the lights
Step up now, you're in for a ride
This is war, ain't no fun and games
We get it up, you go down in flames
Party time, goin' down
You better not mess us around
The stakes are rich, take a hit or stay
The price is high, someone's gonna pay
Heads I win, tails you lose
Out of my way, I'm comin' through
Roll the dice, don't think twice
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Lookin' for trouble, now you've found it
You're a drum and we're gonna pound it
Last one standin' wins the fight
Hear us scream and shout all night
Down on the floor and eat the grit
This is gonna hurt a little bit
Heads I win, tails you lose
Out of my way, I'm comin' through
Roll the dice, don't think twice
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Now we lay you down to rest
You'll never be more than second best
Step inside, you're in for a ride
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Crush, crush
Crush, crush
Don't need reason (crush), don't want names
Just a John Doe (crush) to put to shame
Step aside (crush), let me explain
The name of the game (crush 'em) is pain
Now we've found you (crush), we're gonna pound you
We're gonna beat you (crush), gonna defeat you
We're gonna bust you (crush), we're gonna crush you
We're gonna (crush 'em) crush 'em
Heads I win, tails you lose
Out of my way, I'm comin' through
Roll the dice, don't think twice
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Now we lay you down to rest
You'll never, never be more than second best
Step inside, you're in for a ride
And we crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Crush, crush
Crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush
Crush, crush 'em
Oh, boy (crush), here we go (crush)
It's time (crush) to crush 'em (crush 'em)
Yeah, and you (crush), shed some tears (crush)
It's gonna hurt (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Not here (crush), not tonight (crush)
It's our town (crush), and we're gonna crush 'em (crush 'em)
Crush (crush), crush (crush)
Crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Crush (crush), crush (crush)
Crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)
Crush (crush), crush (crush)
Crush (crush), crush 'em (crush 'em)...
