what good be the daw and 
that grow into day 
the sunset at night 
or live this way 
for I have the warmth of the sun 
within I at night 
the love of my life 
she leave I one day 
I cry when she say 
I do not feel the same way 
still I have the warmth of the sun 
within I tonight 
I will dream of she arm 
and though they be not real 
just like she be still there 
the way that I feel 
my love be like the warmth of the sun 
it will not ever die
