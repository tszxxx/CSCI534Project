[Verse 1]
I should've seen all the signs all around me
But I was comfortable inside these wounds
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you
[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me
[Verse 2]
How can you help my affliction
If you're the sickness and not the cure
Too long I've faked this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure
[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me
[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up (Oooh, ooooh)
You take it all but still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me (Oooh, ooooh)
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me
[Bridge]
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget
I know I can never prove this illusion
You aren't the one that I thought you were
So I learn to embrace this delusion
The line that separates us starts to blur
[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all but still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me
[Outro]
(Oooh, ooooh)
And you will be the death of me
I won't forget, I cannot forget this! (Oooh, ooooh)
And you will be the death of me
(Oooh, ooooh)
(Oooh, ooooh)
(Oooh, ooooh)
