[Verse 1]
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your loving man has gone
[Chorus]
Hear what I say
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back till fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And I won't be back till fall
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all
[Chorus]
Hear what I say, I said
[Outro]
See see rider
Oh see what you have done
Yeah, yeah, yeah
