I will have a blue Christmas without you 
I will be so blue just think about you 
decoration of red 
on a green Christmas tree 
will not mean a thing dear if you be not here with I 
and the wind know blue snowflake start fall 
when those blue blue memory start call 
you will be do alright 
with you Christmas of white 
oh but I will have a blue blue Christmas 
you will be do alright 
with you Christmas of white 
oh but I will have a blue blue Christmas 
and when you need and pray on this Christmas day 
remember I have a blue blue Christmas 
remember I have a blue blue Christmas 
and remember I have a blue blue Christmas
