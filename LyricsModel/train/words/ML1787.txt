as we stroll along together 
holding hand walk all along 
so in love be we two 
that we do not know what to do 
so in love 
in a world of we own 
and as we walk by the sea together 
under star twinkle high above 
so in love be we two 
no one else but I and you 
so in love 
so much in love 
so in love 
so much in love 
we stroll along together 
I tell you I need you oh so much 
I love I love you my darling 
can you tell it in my touch 
as we walk down the aisle together 
we will vow to be together til we die 
so in love be we two 
just can not wait to say I do 
so in love 
in a world of we own 
so in love 
be you and I 
baby I hope you realize that you mean so much to I 
you be everything I ever want in a woman 
to touch you to feel you body close to I 
I just want to hold you in my arm forever 
I love you baby 
can you tell it in my touch 
as we walk down the aisle together 
we will vow to be together til we die 
so in love be we two 
just can not wait to say I do 
so in love 
be you and I 
so in love 
be you and I 
so in love 
so in love 
so in love 
so in love
