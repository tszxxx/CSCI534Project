[Chorus]
Now you know I'm ready
Can't you see I'm ready?
Well, hell, you know I'm ready
Now you know I'm ready
[Verse]
One more time around the block with me
One more time around the block
One more time around the block with me
Just for me
[Chorus]
Now you know I'm ready
Can't you see I'm ready?
Well, hell, you know I'm ready
Now you know I'm ready
[Verse]
One more time around the block with me
One more time around the block
One more time around the block with me
Just for me
[Refrain]
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
[Chorus]
Now you know I'm ready
Can't you see I'm ready?
Well, hell, you know I'm ready
Now you know I'm ready
[Verse]
One more time around the block with me
One more time around the block
One more time around the block with me
Just for me
[Chorus]
Now you know I'm ready
Can't you see I'm ready?
Well, hell, you know I'm ready
Now you know I'm ready
[Verse]
One more time around the block with me
One more time around the block
One more time around the block with me
Just for me
[Refrain]
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
