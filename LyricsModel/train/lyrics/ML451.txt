Just the other day
Said I ran into this beautiful lady
She asked me my name
And I told her it's Gyptian
Immediately she said
Boy I gotta give you something from her body
And I said baby quickly
She said don't want you to tell nobody
That I gave it to you so easy
I said with me baby ya don't need to worry
She said Ohh and Ahhh
She never felt so right
I said Yes my baby
Bring it on me tonight
She said Ohh and Ahhh
She never felt so right
I said Yes my baby
Bring it on me tonight
Woman of my dreams
You have become reality
Part of my subconsciousness
And my immortality
I'm the happiest man in the world
Because I have you for my girl
And I promise you my baby
I'm gonna take you on tours around the world
Yeah baby
She said Ohh and Ahh
She never felt so right
I said Yes my baby
Bring it on me tonight
She said Ohh and Ahhh
She never felt so right
I said Yes my baby
Bring it on me tonight
Just the other day
