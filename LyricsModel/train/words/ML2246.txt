Morning have just begin 
and I gaze into the rise sun 
like every day to day you be on my mind 
and even though I be far I know where you be 
and I know it will not be very long 
I will be on my way come home 
I smell you perfume on the breeze 
as a hint of jasmine 's call I 
while the tree be whisper you name 
and all the thing that they do remind I of you 
and I know it will not be very long 
I will be on my way come home 
go home sweet home 
very soon I will be come home 
home baby home 
to my lady home 
that be where my heart be home 
I be come home I be come I be come 
home to my baby I be come home 
to my lady home 
home home home home home 
so tonight before you go to sleep 
and you pray on high we soul to keep 
then cast you dream to the star above 
and when you awake I will gently touch you face 
all you lonely moment will be go 
when I be all alone I be home 
I be home sweet home 
very soon I will be come home 
I be come home baby

Home that be where my heart be 
Home no it be never a-part
