it be not a silly little moment 
it be not the storm before the calm 
this be the deep and die breath of 
this love that we have be work on 
can not seem to hold you like I want to 
so I can feel you in my arm 
nobody be go to come and save you 
we pull too many false alarm 
we be go down 
and you can see it too 
we be go down 
and you know that we be doomed 
my dear we be slow dance in a burn room 
I be the one you always dream of 
you be the one I try to draw 
how dare you say it be nothing to I 
baby you be the only light I ever see 
I will make the most of all the sadness 
you will be a bitch because you can and 
you try to hit I just to hurt I 
so you leave I feel dirty 
cause you can not understand 
we be go down 
and you can see it too 
we be go down 
and you know that we be doomed 
my dear we be slow dance in a burn room 
go cry about it why do not you 
go cry about it why do not you 
go cry about it why do not you 
my dear we be slow dance in a burn room 
burning room 
burning room 
burning room 
burning room 
do not you think we ought to know by now 
do not you think we should have learn somehow 
do not you think we ought to know by now 
do not you think we should have learn somehow 
do not you think we ought to know by now 
do not you think we should have learn somehow
