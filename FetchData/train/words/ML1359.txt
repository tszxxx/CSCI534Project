I can hear she heart beat for a thousand mile and the heaven open every time she smile and when I come to she that 's where I belong yet I be run to she like a river 's song she give I love , love , love , love , crazy love she give I love , love , love , love , crazy love she 's get a fine sense of humor when I be feeling low down and when I come to she when the sun go down take away my trouble , take away my grief take away my heartache , in the night like a thief she give I love , love , love , love , crazy love she give I love , love , love , love , crazy love yes I need she in the daytime yes I need she in the night yes I want to throw my arm around she kiss she hug she kiss she hug she tight and when I be return from so far away she give I some sweet loving brighten up my day yes it make I righteous , yes it make I feel whole yes it make I mellow down in to my soul she give I love , love , love , love , crazy love she give I love , love , love , love , crazy love
