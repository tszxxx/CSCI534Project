we can not play this game anymore but can we still be friend ? Things just can not go on like before but can we still be friend ? we have something to learn now it 's time for the wheel to turn Grains of sand , one by one before you know it , all go let 's admit we make a mistake but can we still be friend ? Heartbreak 's never easy to take but can we still be friend ? it 's a strange , sad affair sometimes seem like we just do not care do not waste time feeling hurt we have be through hell together ( La la lala la la lala la can we still be friend ? ) can we still get together sometime ( La la lala la la lala la can we still be friend ? ) you know life will still go on and on and on we awoke from we dream Things be not always what they seem memory linger on it 's like a sweet , sad old song
