[Spoken Intro]
Ah man, I ain't seen you in a long time
Brother, come on in, man
Sit on down and relax yourself, take your shoes off
I wanna let - I got a song I want you to hear
Boy, this thing is mad
I want you to check out this groove, okay
Hold on one second, let me put the needle down right here
Check it out
Joy
Joy
[Chorus]
It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me
It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me
[Verse 1]
Lady, can't you see just how much you mean to me
Get a thrill each time I'm near you
I get such a rush, I crave to feel your tender touch
Magic moment paradise, oh baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Life is too damn short to let you get away
I'm here to say I need your love, oh baby
There's no greater pleasure than you give to me
Hear me, baby, I want you to know
[Chorus]
It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me
It's a joy
(It's a joy)
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me
[Verse 2]
Darling, don't you know, my heart longs to hold you so
Passion burns inside my mind
You're my fantasy, no other love can set me free
I'm glad to know that you're all mine, mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Sailing through the night, I'll find the certain pleasures
A million stars feel like the moon, so full of love
Nothin' takes the place of romance since you came
But all we need is you and me, baby
(You and me)
[Chorus]
It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me
It's a joy
Joy to be
I wanna be near you
I want you here with me
It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I, I want you here with me
It's a joy, oh baby
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me
[Bridge]
We're meant to be and I know we can win
At times I feel like a kid on a Ferris wheel
You make my world go 'round and around
So much to live for and I'm livin' it now
