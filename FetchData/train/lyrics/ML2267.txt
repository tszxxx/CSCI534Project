[Verse 1]
Grab your gun, time to go to hell
I'm no hero guilty as charged
Search and destroy
Found my faith, living in sin
I'm no Jesus, but neither are you my friend
I'm a whore, a birth of broken dreams
This simple answer is never what it seems
[Chorus]
A million little pieces we've broken into
A million little pieces I've stolen from you
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy, search and destroy
[Verse 2]
Sold my soul, to heaven and to hell
Sick as my secrets, but never gonna tell
Love to blame, burden of my dreams
A curse of faith and a blessing I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe (A million little pieces)
I believe
[Chorus]
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy
[Bridge]
Let go, let go
Let me go, let me go
Let go, let go
Let me go
Search and destroy (a million little pieces)
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces (search and destroy)
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
Stolen from you!
[Chorus]
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy, search and destroy
[Outro]
A million little pieces
A million little pieces to start
