I be free I be free 
and freedom taste of reality 
I be free I be free 
and I be wait for you to follow I 
if I tell you what it take 
to reach the highest high 
you would laugh and say nothing be that simple 
but you have be tell many time before 
messiah point to the door 
and no one have the gut to leave the temple 
I be free I be free 
and freedom taste of reality 
I be free I be free 
and I be wait for you to follow I 
how can we follow 
how can we follow
