dance in the living room cut up a rug 
dancing with the baby look more like a hug 
live in a house make of sawmill wood 
Rollover Beethoven never sound so good 
chorus 
so come on baby baby let 's go 
where we get the money honey I do not know 
but one more baby be alright by I 
we will just add another limb to the family tree 
well raise up baby be we new sport 
you be one day late and I be a dollar short 
now maybe it be plan and maybe it be a goof 
but a cat 's just get to dance on a hot tin roof 
chorus 
yeah come on baby baby let 's go 
where we get the money honey I do not know 
but one more baby be alright by I 
we will just add another limb to the family tree 
well the lawnmower 's break and the tax be due 
and if I find another tick I be go to come unglued 
we get hand I down clothes and hand I down shoe 
we get the big belly momma -here we go again blues 
chorus 
hey hey baby baby let 's go 
where we get the money honey I do not know 
but one more baby be alright by I 
we will just add another limb to the family tree 
baby whooooahh 
where we get the money hell I do not know 
one more baby be alright by I

we will just add another limb to the family tree 
well just add another limb baby 
we will just add another limb to the family tree
