[Intro]
[Verse 1]
They took me lightly like a quiet boosting of a piece of candy
From your favorite neighborhood corner store
Surely shoulda saw the weight
A heavy burden to carry the bare soiled slate
They don't wanna have a thing to do with
Can't blame them take a look
Can't name 'em cause they shook
Took over some wit-protect
Stay with your kin boy
Fuck around with B'more
Make you look like you're white in a Harlem shaking contest
I harness the fondest crooks of phonics
Fuck grammar, ill-mannered
Don't start with Spank
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Awww ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat, I'm more you're more the less
Oh ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat now, now I suggest you take a rest
[Verse 2]
Can't say what I will or won't do
Stretch the height
You might want to stay on your toes to
Secure a full view
For skewed vision conditions lead you to assume
And while you assume
I'm feeling uneasy
My patterns are broken
Shared my thoughts but my guts don't even believe me
Sleep don't relieve me, it's like doom conceived me
Got a whole lot of something, yet I constantly feel
Like nothing much, just your average such and such
So much acclaimed moving
But nigga I'm really touched
What was I drinking?
(falling under would've boxed that nigga
If you didn't pull me back, spitting on his new shoes)
What was he thinking?
(man I wonder, do I smile too much?
Yes, you too can get fucked up)
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...
I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it and in the end
All these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...
I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is
(sit the fuck…there ain't no dancing, no dancing)
[Verse 3 x 2]
My tongue is the drum
My mind’s the machine
Non dreamer's far fantastic extremes
Fall victim to this think tank-M16
Sound, sharp, fixed, fit, creased, greased, and clean
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...
I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...
I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
