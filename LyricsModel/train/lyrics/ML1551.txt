[Verse 1]
It's so sad, livin' at home
Far from the city and the midnight fun
It's so bad, goin' to school
So far from me and the dirty things that we've done
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the night time world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the night time world
Come live your secret dream
[Verse 2]
It's so fine, lovin' with ease
Far from the house and the family fights
It's so fine, bein' with you
Bein' with me makes everything alright
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the night time world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the night time world
Come live your secret dream
Alright
[Verse 3]
It's so sad, you're not content
Far from the music and the neon glow
Ain't you glad we got the time
Far from our folks, they'll never ever know
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the night time world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the night time world
Come live your secret dream
[Bridge]
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the night time world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the night time world
Come live your secret dream
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the night time world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the night time world
Come live your secret dream
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the night time world
And you're my headlight queen
I'm the king of the night time world
Come live your secret dream
