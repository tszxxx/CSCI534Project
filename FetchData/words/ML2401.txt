somewhere south of the border Headin ' for a doll serenade take more than we aughta ' Shakin ' off the masquerade Lonely , she decide to see ya ' get enough for she on the side when the heat arrive at the motel Whole town stay inside some lie for love some lie for fame some lie for trust some lie in vain some lie for love some lie for gain but I lie for you in the pour rain move on up to the Bayou with the same old set of rule you get nothin ' for nothin ' and that 's a fact when you be tie to the ship of fool Alice look over she shoulder like a chinese diplomat daring anyone to hold she with a smile like a cheshire cat some lie for love some lie for fame some lie for trust some lie in vain some lie for love some lie for gain but I lie for you in the pour rain Shakin ' to a halt on a Voodoo Second oldest trick in the book no one do it quite like you do when you start you can never stop ... never stop on my way to a seance Met a gypsy renegade cross my palm with silver in my heart put a jag stake some lie for love some lie for fame some lie for trust some lie in vain some lie for love some lie for gain but I lie for you in the pour rain
