[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time
[Verse 2]
And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue
[Verse 4]
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time
[Verse 2]
And I can't stop wanting you
I said it's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
