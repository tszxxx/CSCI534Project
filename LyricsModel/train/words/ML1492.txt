somewhere over the rainbow 
Way up high 
there be a land that I hear of 
once in a lullaby 
somewhere over the rainbow 
Skies be blue 
and the dream that you dare to dream 
really do come true 
some day I will wish upon a star 
and wake up where the cloud be far behind I 
where trouble melt like lemondrop 
away above the chimney top 
that be where you will find I 
somewhere over the rainbow 
bluebird fly 
bird fly over the rainbow 
why then oh why can not I 
some day I will wish upon a star 
and wake up where the cloud be far behind I 
where trouble melt like lemondrop 
away above the chimney top 
that be where you will find I 
somewhere over the rainbow 
bluebird fly 
bird fly over the rainbow 
why then oh why can not I 
if happy little bluebird fly 
beyond the rainbow 
why oh why can not I
