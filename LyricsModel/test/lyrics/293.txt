[Verse 1]
Sparks fly, it's like electricity
I might die when I forget how to breathe
You get closer, and there's nowhere in this world I'd rather be
Time stops, like everything around me is frozen
And nothing matters but these few moments
When you open my mind to things I've never seen
[Chorus]
'Cause when I’m kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you
When I’m kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, "Are you the one? Should I really trust?"
Crystal clear, it becomes when I’m kissin' you
[Verse 2]
Past loves, they never got very far
Walls up, make sure I guarded my heart
And I promised I wouldn't do this
'Til I knew it was right for me
But no one (No one)
No guy that I've met before
Could make me (Make me) feel so right and secure
And have you noticed I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears?
[Chorus]
'Cause when I’m kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you
When I’m kissin' u, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, "Are you the one? Should I really trust?"
Crystal clear, it becomes when I’m kissin' you
[Bridge]
I've never felt nothing like this
You're making me open up
No point even tryin' to fight this
It kinda feels like it's love
[Chorus]
'Cause when I’m kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you
When I’m kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, "Are you the one? Should I really trust?"
Crystal clear, it becomes when I’m kissin' you
