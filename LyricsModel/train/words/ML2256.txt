oh the glory of true love 
be a wild and precious thing 
it do not grow on old magnolias 
or only blossom in the spring 
no the glory of true love 
be it will last you whole life through 
never will go out of fashion 
always will look good on you 
you can climb the highest mountain 
touch the moon and star above 
but old faithful be just a fountain 
compare to the glory of true love 
long before I meet you darlin 
Lord I think I have it all 
I could have my lunch in London 
and my dinner in St. Paul 
I get some friend in Albuquerque 
where the governor call I Gov 
you can give them all to goodwill 
for the glory of true love 
you can climb the highest mountain 
touch the moon and star above 
but old faithful be just a fountain 
compare to the glory of true love 
glory glory glory glory 
you can not never get enough 
time alone will tell the story 
of the glory of true love 
glory glory glory glory 
you can not never get enough 
time alone will tell the story 
of the glory of true love
