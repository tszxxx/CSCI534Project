[Verse 1]
I meant to come back to put out bliss
But the style's crumbling, covered, canned
It was sick and no, you don't even know how
It comes and shifts, then gets ruined by you fucking slobs
[Chorus]
It's classical anyway
[Verse 2]
I can't help it, it makes me so sick over and over
It sits stiff, bound with no heart
Fine, 'cause this is where the separation starts arising
I can see it coming over your cloud
[Chorus]
It's classical anyway
How cool are you?
I remember
[Bridge]
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
[Verse 3]
It's just a bad call
It's so funny how you think I'm so serious, but that's not it
The thing is, I don't give enough jack to give a fuck
You're just plain boring and you bore me asleep
[Chorus]
It's classical anyway
How cool are you?
I remember
[Bridge]
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
[Bridge]
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
[Verse 4]
And who the fuck are you anyway, you fuck?
It's making sick sense seeing how you're sticking out
Hardly hoping, about to please, rise up off the fucking knees
And I'm about to train you for a second, try to find your fucking heart
[Chorus]
It's classical anyway
How cool are you?
I remember
[Bridge]
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
[Bridge]
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
[Outro]
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick
