[Verse 1]
Have a drink they're buying
Bottom of, bottle of denial
[Chorus 1]
Big guy,... big eye,... watching me...
Have to wonder what it sees...
(Sin...)
Progress... laced with... ramifications...
Freedom's big plunge
[Chorus 2]
Pull the innocent from a crowd
Raise the sticks then bring them down
If they fail to obey... oh if they fail to obey
[Verse 2]
For every tool they lend us... a loss of independence
[Chorus 3]
I pledge my grievance to the flag
Because you don't give blood... to take it back again
Oh we're all deserving something more
[Chorus 1]
Progress,... taste it,... invest-it-all
Champagne breakfast for everyone
[Chorus 2]
Break the innocent when they're proud...
Raise the stakes,... then bring em down...
If they fail to obey... oh if they fail to obey
[Chorus 3]
Pledge your grievance to the flag
Because you don't give blood... then take it back again
Oh we're all deserving something more
[Outro]
I want to breathe
Follow the scene
I want to taste
Everyone I see
I want to run when I'm up high
I want to run into the sea
I only want life.... to be...
I just want to be...
I will feel alive... as long as I am free...
