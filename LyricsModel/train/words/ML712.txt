we call they cool 
those heart that have no scar to show 
the one that never do let go 
and risk the table be turn 
we call they fool 
who have to dance within the flame 
who chance the sorrow and the shame 
that always come with get burn 
but you have get to be tough when consume by desire 
cause it be not enough just to stand outside the fire 
we call they strong 
those who can face this world alone 
who seem to get by on they own 
those who will never take the fall 
we call they weak 
who be unable to resist 
the slightest chance love might exist 
and for that forsake it all 
they be so hell bent on give walk a wire 
convince it be not live if you stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
life be not try it be merely survive 
if you be stand outside the fire 
there be this love that be burn deep in my soul 
constantly yearn to get out of control 
want to fly higher and higher 
I can not abide stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
life be not try it be merely survive 
if you be stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
life be not try it be merely survive 
if you be stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
stand outside the fire 
life be not try it be merely survive 
if you be stand outside the fire
