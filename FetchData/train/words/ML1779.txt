I hear music Mighty fine music the murmur of a morning breeze up there the rattle of the milkman on the stair sure that 's music Mighty fine music the sing of a sparrow in the sky the perking of the coffee right near by that 's my favorite melody you my angel , phon I I hear music Mighty fine music and anytime I think my world be wrong I get I out of bed and sing this song
