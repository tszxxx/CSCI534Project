[Verse 1]
I sit here on the stairs and listen to
The night time as the daylight fades away
It's such a haunting and familiar tune
When I hear it in the distance I can say
[Chorus]
That I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I'm home
[Verse 2]
The North Shore is where my father lives
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride
But the Berkshires are where my heart is
And when I see them in the distance I could cry
[Chorus]
Because I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
[Bridge]
Nyla started pre-school, and Indie just turned two
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
They keep getting older, and time keeps going by
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry
[Verse 3]
So I just passed the sign that welcomes me to Worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that hasnâ€™t really changed with time
The way this country that I love, it used to be
[Chorus]
Because I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
[Outro]
Because I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my hero teaches classes everyday
Where my friends, don't treat me different
It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay
Because I'm home
