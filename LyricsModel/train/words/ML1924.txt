you be the only thing 
I know I can be sure of 
call I crazy 
you be the one that I want more of 
and when we be walk 
there be not a cloud 
in the way of my sunny day 
I know they be talk 
there be not a thing they could say 
that could stand in the way of we love 
love of we love love 
happy just to stay with you 
here in a bubble 
let they word roll off I 
when they say that you be just trouble 
and I will keep walk 
there be not a doubt in the way 
of we sunny day 
they can keep talk 
there be not a thing they could say 
that could get in the way of this love 
love of this love love 
cause when we be walk 
there be not a cloud in the way 
of we sunny day 
I be sure they be talk 
there be not a thing they could say 
that could stand in the way of we love 
love love my love
