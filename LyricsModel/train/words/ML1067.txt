I use to think that love be so silly 
something that a girl like I never dream of 
it never be for I no not really 
but there be not a guy who be special enough 
until you come and make I so happy 
like a child on Christmas Day 
I be so so so so anticipate 
and I do not know I could ever feel this way 
love see it 
hey love see the change in my heart 
you bring I so much joy 
love see it 
love see the hope of a girl and a boy boy ooh 
oh you bring I joy

I use to think that love be a mystery 
something that a guy just could not figure out 
and I never have no past history 
not even a clue what true love be about 
until you come and make life worth living 
like the very first day of spring 
I be so so anticipate 
girl I do not know I have love inside of I
