my father he do tell I 
to never ever hurt no one 
but now I be sick a mad and I be catch red hand 
and I be still father 's son 
I lay awake till daylight 
a pillow and a gun 
and if my secret dream could be see on screen 
then they will be come for this one 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
please lord now forgive I 
even though I do not deserve 
I never be too good in life 
the devil 's all I serve 
my woman she do leave I 
I tell twice to go 
the first time she ignore I 
but then I throw she on the floor 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
well I sleep with one eye open 
I weep with both eye close 
Darkness come down on I and 
tomorrow never know 
ever I suffer 
ever suffer my fill 
and if you do not pray for I now 
nobody ever will 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
now I be in the graveyard 
it be darkness all around 
voice float through the air speak with no sound 
you be you father 's son 
but you leave he far beyond 
beyond the reach of mercy 
in the darkness of the sun 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
so down low better slow down lord 
I be so down low better slow down lord 
I be so down low better slow down lord 
I be so down low better slow down lord
