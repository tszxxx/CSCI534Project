good night 
it be stroke time 
let 's get paralyse down both side 
snake hip red city kiss 
and you black eye roll back 
Midnight Organ fight 
you be give into mine 
it be all right 
and the fast blood 
Hurricanes through I 
and then it rip my roof away with she fire head 
this be the longest kiss 
good night 
Oh.. 
and now I I tremble 
because this fumble 
have become biblical 
I feel like I just die twice 
be reborn again 
for all we dirty sin 
and the fast blood fast blood fast blood 
Hurricanes through I 
and then it rip my roof away with she fire head 
this be the longest kiss 
good night 
good night 
and then I fall down 
I stumble 
and she say good night
