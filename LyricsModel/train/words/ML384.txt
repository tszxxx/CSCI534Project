I miss you I miss you 
hello there 
the angel from my nightmare 
the shadow in the background of the morgue 
the unsuspect victim of darkness in the valley 
we can live like Jack and Sally if we want 
where you can always find I 
and we will have Halloween on Christmas 
and in the night we will wish this never end 
we will wish this never end 
I miss you I miss you 
I miss you I miss you 
where be you 
and I be so sorry 
I can not sleep I can not dream tonight 
I need somebody and always 
this sick strange darkness 
come creep on so haunt every time 
and as I stare I count 
the web from all the spider 
catch thing and eat they inside 
like indecision to call you 
and hear you voice of treason 
will you come home and stop this pain tonight 
stop this pain tonight 
chorus Tom DeLonge and 
Mark Hoppus 

do not waste you time on I you be already 
the voice inside my head 
I miss you I miss you 

do not waste you time on I you be already 
the voice inside my head 
I miss you I miss you 

chorus Tom DeLonge and 
Mark Hoppus 

do not waste you time on I you be already 
the voice inside my head 
I miss you I miss you 

do not waste you time on I you be already 
the voice inside my head 
I miss you I miss you 

do not waste you time on I you be already 
the voice inside my head 
I miss you I miss you 

do not waste you time on I you be already 
the voice inside my head 
I miss you I miss you 

I miss you I miss you 
I miss you I miss you 
I miss you I miss you 
I miss you I miss you
