I can love you better 
lose myself in love 
I use to do it for the love a long time ago 
and all i ever want be love 
I use to love without fear a long time ago 
and all i ever want be love 
then somebody come around and try to hurt I 
try to make I feel like i be unworthy 
take a pure love and try to make it dirty 
Truth be they never do deserve I no 
I have to lose myself so i could love you better 
I have to lose myself have to lose myself so i could 
love you better lose myself in love 
and that be just the way it be 
could n?t tell I i be in love when i need it 
when all i ever want be love 
should a tell I i be worth receive it 
but all i ever want be love 
there be something awkward about the selflessness it 
take to 
give love and the good that it make you 
true love can never really forsake you 
but it take a little while just for I to see 
I have to lose myself so i could love you better 
I have to lose myself have to lose myself so i could 
make it better

so i could love you better 
lose myself in love 
and that be just the way it be 
I have a paralyzing fear of face failure 
and i could not love you perfectly with that fear in my head 
so i perilously have to face the danger 
so i could come back and love you whole instead 
all of you soul i say 
so i could make it better 
I have to lose myself have to lose myself 
so i could love you better 
have to lose myself have to lose myself so i could 
make it better 
lose myself in love 
and that be just the way it be 
and so it go that i never mean to hurt you 
could n?t stay but i never mean to desert you 
Whole lot a thing i just have to work through 
time to heal and restore my self worth too 
confrontation of my fear and anxiety 
cry a whole lot of year i suffer quietly 
and though it may have take year i can finally 
tell you that you be always on my mind
