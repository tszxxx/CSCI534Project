[Verse 1]
This is my right
A right given by God
To live a free life
To live in freedom
[Chorus]
Talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
[Verse 2]
Anyone tries to take it away
They'll have to answer, 'cause this is my right
[Chorus]
I'm talking about freedom
Talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
I'm talking about freedom
Talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
[Chorus]
Everybody talking about freedom
We're talking about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom
Talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom
