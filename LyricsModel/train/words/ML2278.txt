blacktop letter write out in chalk 
that she might see I when school be over 
dripping thought fall onto you sidewalk 
I could only tell you when I be not sober 
it be not you fault 
cryptic message write in the dark 
all that haunt I be surely closure 
lock hand float through the park 
they always watch I lose composure 
it be not you fault
