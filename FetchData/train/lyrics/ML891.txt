[Verse 1]
On many days it goes unspoken
But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close
I think I'll pray
I hear you say you've got got a lot to give up
And there is so much more this heart of mine can take
If what you have to bring to me is positive
You send it right away
Right away
[Chorus]
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love (I wanna know)
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
Good love, good love
Good love, good love
[Verse 2]
There is a void that stands between us
And it seems it's getting harder to relate
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine
Life this way
[Chorus]
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love (Show me)
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Hear me when I say, bring it to me baby
[Bridge]
If you're the man I hear you say you are
I don't quite understand why loving me is so hard
Never have I felt the need to be this close
Words cannnot say, heaven only knows
[Chorus]
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
(stand by me)
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
(somebody stand by me)
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love (show me)
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Morning, noon and night, forever all my life
