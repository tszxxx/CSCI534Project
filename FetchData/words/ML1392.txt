can you believe this world 's get the nerve to insist they will not trade for a better one ? can you believe this world 's yell out in the dark it want to be leave alone ? can you believe this world never would have have the chance without we give it blood ? can you believe this world lack the common courtesy to thank we all for the love ? set it on fire ! set it on fire ! set it on fire ! set it on fire ! set it on fire ! can you believe this world 's like a glassy eye swiller catch sipping another one ? can you believe this world 's like a tyrant take over anything that it want ? can you believe this world 's like a wounded martyr worried if he commitment be go ? can you believe this world 's like a vagrant in the gutter talk nothing be wrong ? can you believe this world 's just a double deal joker , go to stick to he gun ? can you believe this world 's just a television blare , a million devil at once ? can you believe this world 's just a charmer in disguise with a lavender soul ? can you believe this world 's just exactly as we build it , run out of control ?
