[Hook: Lou Reed]
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load
[Verse 1: Lou Reed]
Some kind of metal
Made up from glue
Some kind of plastic
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old
[Hook: 2D]
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load
[Verse 2: Lou Reed]
Well, me, I like plastics
And digital foils
To wrap up the sound
And protect the girls
From the spiritual poison
You spill at night
Like phony clothes but
I really like mine
[Hook 2: Lou Reed and (2D)]
(Some kind of nature)
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
(Come forth within us)
(Oh Lord, forgive me)
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
(It's gonna come and find us)
(All we are is stars)
[Verse 3: Lou Reed, (2D) and 
Both
]
(Some kind of metal), some kind of metal
(Made up from glue), made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, (some kind of plastic)
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old
[Hook 2: Lou Reed and (2D)]
(Some kind of nature)
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
(Come forth within us)
(Oh Lord, forgive me)
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
(It's gonna come and find us)
(All we are is stars)
