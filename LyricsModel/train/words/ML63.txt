the world be a vampire 
send to drain 
secret destroyer 
hold you up to the flame 
and what do I get 
for my pain 
betray desire 
and a piece of the game 
even though I know 
I suppose I will show 
all my cool and cold 
like ol job 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
someone will say what be lose can never be save 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
now I be naked 
nothing but a animal 
but can you fake it 
for just one more show 
and what do you want 
I want to change 
what do you get 
when you feel the same 
even though I know 
I suppose I will show 
all my cool and cold 
like ol job 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
then someone will say what be lose can never be save 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
tell I I be the only one 
tell I there be no other one 
Jesus be a only son yeah 
tell I I be the choose one 
Jesus be a only son for you 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
and someone will say what be lose can never be save 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a 
despite all my rage I be still just a rat in a cage

Jesus be a only son for you 
and I still believe that I can not be save 
and I still believe that I can not be save 
and I still believe that I can not be save 
and I still believe that I can not be save
