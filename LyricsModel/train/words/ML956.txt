let 's go down to the Sunset Grill 
we can watch the working girl go by 
watch the basket people walk around and mumble 
stare out at the auburn sky 
there be a old man there from the old world 
to he it be all the same 
call all he customer by name 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
you see a lot more meanness in the city 
it be the kind that eat you up inside 
hard to come away with anything that feel like dignity 
hard to get home with any pride 
these day a man make you something 
and you never see he face 
but there be no hiding place 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
respectable little murder pay 
they get more respectable every day 
do not worry girl 
I be go to stick by you 
and someday soon 
we be go to get in that car 
and get out of here 
let 's go down to the Sunset Grill 
watch the work girl go by 
watch the basket people walk around and mumble 
gaze out at the auburn sky 
maybe we will leave come springtime 
meanwhile have another beer 
what would we do without all these jerk anyway 
besides all we friend be here 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill 
down at the Sunset Grill
