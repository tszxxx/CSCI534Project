sometimes I feel I have get to run away I have get to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of I the love we share seem to go nowhere and I have lose my light for I toss and turn I can not sleep at night once I run to you now , I will run from you this taint love you have give I give you all a boy could give you take my tear and that 's not nearly all oh , taint love Tainted love now , I know I have get to run away , I have get to get away you do not really want any more from I to make thing right you need someone to hold you tight and you think love be to pray but I be sorry , I do not pray that way once I run to you now , I will run from you this taint love you have give I give you all a boy could give you take my tear and that 's not nearly all oh , taint love Tainted love do not touch I please I can not stand the way you tease I love you , though you hurt I so now , I be go to pack my thing and go Tainted love , oh , taint love , oh Tainted love , oh , taint love , oh touch I , baby , taint love touch I , baby , taint love Tainted love , oh Tainted love , oh Tainted love
