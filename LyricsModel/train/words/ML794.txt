listen 
from the day we meet you have I on the run 
I try to fight it but it be about to take it 's toll 
I can not stop it now I think I find the groove 
one more night and I will make my move 
see lady luck come on my side 
it be a hard knock line string with some vibe 
no matter what you will say or do 
I can not live my life without you 
give I some satisfaction 
just to hear of you action 
I want you love 
gimme you love 
early in the morning 
you have my pony jonnin 
I need you love

I can not go to work without a taste of you love 
I never hold or take lead I right back home 
it might sound strange but I be addicted to you smile 
and the way you move girl it drive I wild yeah 
never know it be wrong till want so bad 
when the want be right I think the wrong can not be bad 
no matter what you put I through

give I some satisfaction 
just to hear of you action
