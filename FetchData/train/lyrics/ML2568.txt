[Pre-Chorus] [Last Caress]
I've got something to say
I killed your baby today
It doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead
I've got something to say
I raped your mother today
It doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread
[Chorus 1] [Last Caress]
Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress
Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress
[Pre-Chorus] [Last Caress]
I've got something to say
I killed your baby today
It doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead
[Chorus 1] [Last Caress]
Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress
One Last Caress
[Chorus 2] [Green Hell]
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell
[Chorus 3] [Green Hell]
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
[Verse] [Green Hell]
We are going to burn in hell - Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell
Try let me get back up there - Green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell
Throw your fucking friends inside - Green hell
Got to fucking pay and you must stay - Green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell
Got to burn it all, green hell
[Chorus 3] [Green Hell]
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
[Chorus 2]
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell
[Chorus 1] [Green Hell]
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
[Ending]
You have come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Going to bring green hell
Green hell
