dirty rotten scoundrel 
that be what I be call on the street 
could connive and cheat but rarely get beat 
ya see I be streetwise a con game pro 
Kickin the Bobby bullshit too smart for Willie Bobo 
not stressin five of 
hot hand in cee lo 
live in the land of crook yes Brooklyn 's the borough 
Homicide central East New York 
where the manic depressive psycho murderer stalk 
walk like a ninja on the asphalt 
here talk be cheap you be outline in chalk 
and there be more hardtime than on Good Times 
and most nigga dedicate they life to crime 
so I be steady schemin' will not work for a dime 
use to get tax free loot all the time 
type slick can not fess on Ru because 
I be the original dirty rotten scoundrel 
before train be graffiti proof I use to get loose 
dirty rotten since the day of the deuce 
dirty because of the skin I be in 
the fact I have 
melanin automatically make I a felon 
even though I be righteous rotten be what you be yellin 
but I be not chain snatchin or drug sellin 
accord to you book you say I would be damned like Ham 
scoundrel opposite of the king that I be 
you want to get funny we can get bummy 
take you to the East and back again money 
filthy putrefy trick step past you sister

mortal Kombat fatality

nasty emcee deity

with the poem that come out of my pi -ne al 
gland 
as I expand you know who I be 
Father of all stylin' I be wildin 
on wax 
we hack shit up like big ax and little ax 
do not need toast to make you jump like bungee 
track real muddy like Brooklyn 's real grungy 
when I come through I clog up you sewer 
peep the maneuveur drop the ill manure 
so bring Mr. Clean Drano and Roto Rooter 
no matter what you do you can not get through the 
crud that come out of you system 
you be another victim of Dirty Rotten 
dirt up in you grill so what ya go to do 
but pay homage to
