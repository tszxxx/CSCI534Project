[Chorus 1: Vince]
Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
Let there be peace on earth
The peace that was meant to be
[Chorus 2]
With God as our father
Brothers all are we
Let us walk with each brother
In perfect harmony
[Chorus 3]
Let peace begin with me
Let this be the moment now
With every step I take
Let this be my solemn vow
[Chorus 4]
To take each moment
And live each moment
In peace eternally
Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
[Chorus 1: Jenny]
Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
Let there be peace on earth
The peace that was meant to be
[Chorus 2]
With God as our father
Brothers all are we
Let me walk with my brother
In perfect harmony
[Chorus 3]
Let peace begin with me
Let this be the moment now
With every step I take
Let this be my solemn vow
[Chorus 4]
To take each moment
And live each moment
In peace eternally
Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
