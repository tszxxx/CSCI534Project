Walkin down the street smoggy eyed 
look at the sky starry eyed 
Searchin for the place weary eyed 
cry in the night teary eyed 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
wonder when I will find paradise 
somewhere there be a home sweet and nice 
wonder if I will find happiness 
never give it up now I guess 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
long instrumental break 
there be no need to search anywhere 
happiness be here have you share 
if you know you be love be secure 
paradise be love to be sure 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
do not you know that it be true 
that for I and for you 
the world be a ghet to 
21 time and fade
