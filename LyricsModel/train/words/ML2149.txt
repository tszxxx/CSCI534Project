smoke linger round you finger 
train heave on to Euston 
do you think you have make the right decision this time 
you have leave you tired family grieving 
and you think they be sad because you be leave 
but do you see the jealousy in the eye of the one who have to stay behind 
and do you think you have make the right decision this time 
you have leave you girlfriend on the platform 
with this really ragged notion that you will return 
but she know that when he go he really go 
and do you think you have make the right decision this time
