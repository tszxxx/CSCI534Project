I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
It won't mean a thing, dear, if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Oh yeah, I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
