Everything i do makes her sad
If i say i love her then it just makes her mad
Nothing i can do will make her love me too
Everything i do makes her sad
Everything i do makes her cry oh my
It just breaks my heart in two when i hear her sigh
There is nothing worse than to know she hurts
Everything i do makes her cry
Call it love
Call it pain
Call it all insane
Love is blind
Love is cruel
Love is fine for fools
Everything i do makes her sad
I could understand it if i treated her bad
But i remind her of some unhappy love
Can't replace the love that she had
So everything i do everything i do
Everything i do makes her sad
