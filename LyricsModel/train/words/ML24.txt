be in love so many time before 
everyone I love walk right out the door 
but I never know that I would 
find someone like you 
take I by the hand 
and help I to stand 
I never know that I would find someone 
chorus 
give I unconditional love 
vamp 
love I right 
hold I tight 
Lord I love you 
Lord I love you
