Met you on a springtime day you be minding you life and I be minding mine , too Lady , when you look my way I have a strange sensation and , darling , that 's when I know that it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along yes , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along oh , I wake up in the night and I reach beside I hope you will be there but instead I find someone who believe in I when I say I would always care oh , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along yes , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along so I live my life in a dream world for the rest of my day just you and I walk hand in hand in a wishful memory oh , I guess that 's all that it would ever be wish I have a time machine I could make myself go back until the day I be bear and I would live my life again and rearrange it so that I would be yours from now on oh , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along yes , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along oh , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along yes , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along oh , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along yes , it 's sad to belong to someone else when the right one come along yes , it 's sad to belong to someone else
