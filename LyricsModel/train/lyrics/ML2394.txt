[Verse 1]
I saw a girl, she was walking down the street
She was selling Holy Bible, lordy
She was looking at me. yeah
She said you know, boy, I can save your soul
For a price I'll have you knocking on heavens door
[Chorus]
But I, get it for free
She said, invest in the lord and you'll invest in me
I said I, I get it for free
I, I, I, I get it for free
[Verse 2]
Done gone, but I forgot
For got what she was selling
I really took me something back
How to get to heaven
But I, I get it for free
I got an angel in the back and she gives it to me
[Chorus]
Well I, I Get it for free
I, I, I
I get it for free
Come on back when you have something to sell
That I don't already have
Maybe you'll come back when my old lady
Is out of town
Then I'll take you straight to heaven
I, well I get it for free
Well I, I, I'
I want it for free
I, I get it for free
I, I, I
I get it for free
Well I'm not asking
I, I take it for free
I, I, I
I get it for free
I said I
I get it for free
I said I, I, I
I get it for free
I, I, I
I get it for free
I said I
I get it for free
