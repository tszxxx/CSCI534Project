[Verse 1: Shirley Collie, 
Willie Nelson
 &amp; 
Both
]
Willingly I fell in love with you
Willingly I learned to love you too
Though we both knew that it was wrong to someone else we both belong
We fell in love willingly
[Verse 2: Shirley Collie, 
Willie Nelson
 &amp; 
Both
]
Willingly I fell although I knew
Sweetheart I knew the same as you
So if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly
[Chorus: Shirley Collie, 
Willie Nelson
 &amp; 
Both
]
I love you, 
I love you too
I want you, 
I want you too
But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly
I love you, 
I love you too
I want you, 
I want you too
But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly
