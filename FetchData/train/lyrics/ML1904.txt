[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That you cradle the sun (I was gonna laugh again)
Living in remorse
Sky is over
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you want to hold me, baby?
Disappointed, going crazy
[Chorus]
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
[Verse 2]
Behind closed eyes lie the minds ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land and all of its creatures?
Your not-so-gentle persuasion has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you want to hold me, baby?
Disappointed, going crazy
[Bridge]
La, la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la, la
Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun
Don't you want me to run?
[Chorus]
Even though you can't afford, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
[Outro]
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
The sky is over us
