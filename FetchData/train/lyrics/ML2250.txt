[Verse 1]
Well there ain't nobody left to impress
And everyone's kissing their own hands
This 666 on the kitchen floor
Ain't no fire in the pan?
[Chorus]
I get lonesome
[x4]
[Verse 2]
So glad to be a slab
Stiff as a stick on a board
I get thoughts and dirty socks
Piled in the corner
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Getting fat on your own fear
Bring that beer over here
I stomp on the floor
Just to make a sound
[Chorus]
