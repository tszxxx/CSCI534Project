(Full version.)
My heart gives a chil
I feel such a thrill
My feet won't keep still
When they swing that music
Rythm like that puts me in a trance
Oh you can't blame me for wanting to dance
From what I understand
It must be just grand
To play in a band
When they swing that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When they swing that music for me
With my eyes I can see
All of the glee
The bees in the knees
When they swing that music
Rythm like that don't do nothing but make me smile
Oh you can't blame me if I'm gone for a while
From what has been said
I'm getting ahead
I'll swing you to bed
Once they've swung that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When you swing that music with me
My head feels a buzz
A reason there was
I feel buzz because
They're swinging that music
Rythm like that sends me up the wall
Oh you can't blame me if I don't wanna fall
From what I have heard
It must mean the world
To dance with that girl
When they swing that music
Oh I'm happy as can be
When you swing that music with me
