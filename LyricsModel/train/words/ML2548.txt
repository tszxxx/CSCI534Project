go 
forever fall into oblivion 
the darkness crawl forward 
it engulf my will to live 
fear be failure 
and this be my motivation 
take back what be steal and 
reclaim all that be lose 
with virtue I will rise up from the ruin 
come on 
through adversity there be redemption 
with passion fighting 
I be unbroken 
through adversity there be redemption 
with passion fighting 
I be unbroken 
take back what be steal and 
embrace the cycle 
refuse to turn back now and be lead astray 
fear be failure 
and this be my affirmation 
through adversity there be redemption 
with passion fighting 
I be unbroken 
through adversity there be redemption 
with passion fighting 
unbroken 
the absence of fear be the renewal of self 
the absence of doubt breed desire 
if there be truth to face 
I will design it 
I will not be deny 
unbroken 
I will not be deny 
I will not be deny 
oh
