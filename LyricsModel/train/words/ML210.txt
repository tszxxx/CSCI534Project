no more 
the crap roll out of you mouth again 
have not change you brain be still gelatin 
little whisper circle around you head 
why do not you worry about you self instead 
who be you where you be where you from 
gossip burn on the tip of you tongue 
you lie so much you believe yourself 
judge not lest ye be judge yourself 
holier than thou 
you be 
holier than thou 
you be 
you know not 
before you judge I take a look at you 
can not you find something better to do 
Point the finger slow to understand 
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand 
it be not who you be it be who you know 
other 's life be the basis of you own 
burn you bridge and build they back with wealth 
judge not lest ye be judge yourself 
holier than thou 
you be 
holier than thou 
you be 
you know not 
yeah who the hell be you 
holier than thou 
you be 
holier than thou 
you be 
you know not
