I be bury up to my neck in 
Contradictionary fly 
I take pride as the king of illiterature 
I be very ape and very nice 
if you ever need anything please do not 
hesitate to ask someone else first 
I be too busy act like I be not naïve 
I have see it all I be here first 
out of the ground 
into the sky 
out of the sky 
into the dirt 
if you ever need anything please do not 
hesitate to ask someone else first 
I be too busy act like I be not naïve 
I have see it all I be here first 
out of the ground 
into the sky 
out of the sky 
into the dirt 
out of the ground 
into the sky 
out of the sky 
into the dirt
