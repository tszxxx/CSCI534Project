ever feel like die 
ever feel alone 
ever feel like crying 
lose child in a store 
ever feel life push shove you away 
ever feel like break down funeral in the rain 
feel like slip away 
stand in the corner and scream with I 
a body full of empty 
a head that be full of rage better believe it 
stand in the closet and scream with I 
a mind that be like a fire 
drive by the pain better believe it 
ever feel like lie 
down inside a grave 
listen to the eulogy 
a buyer of the hate 
ever dance beside the devil 
taste the barrel of a gauge 
ever pull the trigger 
the light begin to fade 
feel like slip away 
stand in the corner and scream with I 
a body full of empty 
a head that be full of rage better believe it 
stand in the closet and scream with I 
a mind that be like a fire 
drive by the pain better believe it 
I have ask you for forgiveness 
I have ask you for you grace 
I have ask you for you blessing 
I have ask that I be save 
stand in the corner and scream with I 
a body full of empty 
a head that be full of rage better believe it 
stand in the corner and scream with I 
a body full of empty 
a head that be full of rage better believe it 
stand in the closet and scream with I 
a mind that be like a fire 
drive by the pain better believe it 
stand in the corner and scream with I 
a body full of empty 
a head that be full of rage better believe it 
stand in the closet and scream with I 
a mind that be like a fire 
drive by the pain better believe it
