as a tear fade away 
and the dawn dry a lover 's eye 
no more tear they be all go 
just believe it will always be 
my heart in you hand 
know that all this belong to I 
and like the child here I stay 
while you heart sing inside of I 
one dream of my live 
one night in eternity 
the wind whisper soft to I 
and heaven stand still 
one sigh of the dawn 
sweet instant of memory 
one celestial rhapsody 
and heaven stand still
