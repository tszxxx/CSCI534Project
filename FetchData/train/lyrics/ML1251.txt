You took hold of my affections
With your Bible and your sword
Your celebrity connections
I was not used to keeping score
From your fine guilded chalice
I drank all your cheap red wine
It was a good place to be Judas (Judas)
Hiding pearls from the swine
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun to you when I come
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun to you when I come
You won me just as I failed you
Fist full of cake, who could refuse
All of my love got stuck in traffic (traffic)
Two thousand miles away from you
Bleeding on into the telephone
On a reupholstered bed of nails
I'm a long, long way from home
I hope my jet lagged heart don't fail
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun to you when I come
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun to you when I come
