sometimes I feel like I be drunk behind the wheel 
the wheel of possibility however it may roll 
give it a spin see if you can somehow factor in 
you know there be always more than one way 
to say exactly what you mean to say 
be I out of my head be I out of my mind 
how could I have ever be so blind 
I be wait for a indication 
it be hard to find 
do not matter what I say only what I do 
I never mean to do bad thing to you 
so quiet but I finally wake up 
if you be sad then it be time you speak up too 
be I out of my head 
be I out of my mind 
how could I have ever be so blind 
I be wait for a indication 
it be hard to find 
do not matter what I say only what I do 
I never mean to do bad thing to you 
so quiet but I finally wake up 
if you be sad then it be time you speak up too 
be I out of my head be I out of my mind 
how could I have ever be so blind 
I be wait for a indication 
it be hard to find 
do not matter what I say only what I do 
I never mean to do bad thing to you 
so quiet but I finally wake up 
if you be sad then it be time you speak up too
