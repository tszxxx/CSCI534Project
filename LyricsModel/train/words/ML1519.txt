have a little love but I spread it thin 
fall in she arm and out again 
make a bad name for my game around town 
tore up my heart and shut it dow and 
nothing to do 
nowhere to be 
a simple little kind of free 
nothing to do 
no one but I 
and that be all I need 
I be perfectly lonely 
I be perfectly lonely 
I be perfectly lonely 
because I do not belong to anyone 
nobody belong to I 
I see friend around from time to time 
when they lady let they slip away 
and when they ask I how I be do with mine 
this be always what I say 
nothing to do 
nowhere to be 
a simple little kind of free 
nothing to do 
no one but I 
and that be all I need 
I be perfectly lonely 
I be perfectly lonely 
I be perfectly lonely 
because I do not belong to anyone 
nobody belong to I 
and this be not to say 
there never come a day 
I will take my chance and start again 
and when I look behind 
on all my younger time 
I have to thank the wrong that lead I to a love so strong 
I be perfectly lonely 
I be perfectly lonely 
I be perfectly lonely 
cause I do not belong to anyone 
nobody belong to I 
that be the way that be the way that be the way that I want it 
that be the way that be the way that be the way that I want it 
that be the way that be the way that be the way that I want it 
that be the way that be the way that be the way that I want it
