pretty paper pretty ribbon of blue 
wrap you present to you darlin from you 
pretty pencil to write I love you 
oh oh pretty paper pretty ribbon of blue 
crowded street busy foot hustle by he 
downtown shopper Christmas be nigh 
there he sit all alone on the sidewalk 
hope that you will not pass he by 
should you stop 
better not much to busy 
you would better hurry my how time do fly 
and in the distance the ringing of laughter 
and in the midst of the laughter he cry 
pretty paper pretty ribbon of blue 
wrap you present to you darlin from you 
pretty pencil to write I love you 
oh oh pretty paper pretty ribbon of blue 
oh oh pretty paper pretty ribbon of blue
