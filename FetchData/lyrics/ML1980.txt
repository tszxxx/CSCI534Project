Oh, don't overflow
Light her up and let her go
Oh, don't overflow
Light her up and let her go
If you're so clever and cool
Who ever could turn you on?
But I'm so clever, it takes no effort
To burn you on
You're just a cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Oh, don't overflow
Light her up and let her go
Oh, don't overflow
Light her up and let her go
If you're so clever and cool
Who ever could turn you on?
But I'm so clever, it takes no effort
To burn you on
You're just a cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
You're just a cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
Cold dust girl
