I be diseased 
can not take the pain 
I would rather die than be alive 
inside of the sobriety 
fuel the fire with the weed and the pill and the booze that will set I free 
throw it away throw it away 
this be my new reckoning 
now here I scream 
the suffering 
it burn like gasoline 
so I self medicate the pain 
to escape this world of shame 
obscurity lead to severity 
so I self medicate the pain 
to escape this world I hate 
I self medicate 
I be dizzy 
from suffocate on the lie you feed 
deny deny you hope of sanity 
fuel the fire with the weed and the pill and the booze that will set I free 
throw I away blow I away throw I away 
this be my new reckoning 
now here I scream 
the suffering 
it burn like gasoline 
so I self medicate the pain 
to escape this world of shame 
obscurity lead to severity 
so I self medicate the pain 
to escape this world I hate 
I self medicate 
stand above myself and watch a part of I die 
I see it all just start to fade away 
though it be true I have always wonder 
how I would say goodbye to myself 
so now I fall again 
and I can not pretend 
there be no resurrection 
so now I fall again 
now hear I scream 
I be diseased 
can not take the pain I would rather die than be alive 
inside of the sobriety 
fuel the fire with the weed and the pill and the booze that will set I free 
throw it away throw it away throw it away 
the suffering 
it burn like gasoline 
so I self medicate the pain 
to escape this world of shame 
obscurity lead to severity 
so I self medicate the pain 
to escape this world I hate 
I self medicate
