how could you ? you be the river pour out of this life how could you ? you be the morning bird who sang I into life every day fly away you be the blood of I the harvest of my dream there 's nowhere I can find peace and the silence will not cease nothing 's quite how it seem the ghost of my joy wo not let I be if you set I free , I will not run I will not run I will not run
