[Intro]
You don't know it's a dream
You don't know if it's real life...
[Verse One]
You don't know it's a dream
You don't know if it's real life
That's what it feels like
To you
You don't know anything
You just know that it feels right
That's when you realize
It's true
[Hook: Yahzarah]
Out of touch, wasting time
My heart (oooh if this is love)
Everything I thought I knew, I lost in you
You're turning me around (oooh if this is love)
[Verse Two]
You don't wonder why
You just know to believe me
Cause I make it easy
To choose
I don't question love
I just go where you lead me
Love is so easy
To lose
[Hook]
{*instrumental interlude*}
[Verse Three]
Eyay, eyay, eyay
Eyay - love, eyay, eyay
Eyay - love, eyay, eyay
Eyay - love, eyay, eyay - it's love
[Hook] w/ ad libs
