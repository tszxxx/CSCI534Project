[Verse 1]
This forest
Is growing faster than I can tell
Cell structure
Eats away at a massive swell
Seems however
I'm a victim of circumstance
Hunt for
Ogres and Dwarfs
Lion-slicer
[Chorus]
Run
With
Death
Run
With
Death
[Verse 2]
White faces
Coming closer with every step
Earth envelopes
Taking breath without happenstance
Carve my teeth out
Ripping through the sheep's head curse
Hunter
Gatherer
Ridden from the cave
[Chorus]
Run
With
Death
Run
With
Death
[Bridge]
Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taken everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now
[Chorus]
Run
With
Death
Run
With
Death
[Outro]
Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taken everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now
