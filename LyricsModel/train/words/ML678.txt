people be strange when you be a stranger 
face look ugly when you be alone 
woman seem wicked when you be unwanted 
street be uneven when you be down 
when you be strange 
face come out of the rain 
when you be strange 
no one remember you name 
when you be strange 
when you be strange 
when you be strange 
people be strange when you be a stranger 
face look ugly when you be alone 
woman seem wicked when you be unwanted 
street be uneven when you be down 
when you be strange 
face come out of the rain 
when you be strange 
no one remember you name 
when you be strange 
when you be strange 
when you be strange yeah 
when you be strange 
face come out of the rain 
when you be strange 
no one remember you name 
when you be strange 
when you be strange 
when you be strange
