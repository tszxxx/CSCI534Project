walk a fine line between wrong and right and I know 
there be a part of I that I try to hide 
but I can not win and I can not fight 
I keep hold on too tight 
run away from the world outside 
now I be call hope you will hear I 
we all need somebody to believe in something 
and I will not fear this when I be fall 
we all need somebody that can mend 
these broken bone 
catch in the confines of the simple life and I be 
holding my head high in the rise tide 
and I can not win and I can not fight 
I keep hold on too tight 
run away from the world outside 
now I be call hope you will hear I 
we all need somebody to believe in something 
and I will not fear this when I be fall 
we all need somebody that can mend 
these broken bone 
I be not come home now I know 
I be so far away so far from home 
I be not come home now I know 
I be so far away I be so far away 
and I can not win and I can not fight 
I keep hold on too tight 
now I be call hope you will hear I 
we all need somebody to believe in something 
and I will not fear this when I be fall 
we all need somebody that can mend 
these broken bone 
and I can not win and I can not fight 
I keep hold on too tight 
run away from the world outside 
and I can not win and I can not fight 
I keep hold on too tight 
run away from the world outside
