[Verse 1]
All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to possess
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness
[Chorus]
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
[Verse 2]
A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For minuscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul
[Chorus]
For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
Oh yeah
[Bridge]
I could have never fathomed this
Such joy, love, and tenderness
That you give to me, yeah
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And I glow, I glow
With just the thought of you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
[Chorus]
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
One more time
For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll, I'll be right there, yeah
Come on, one more time
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there
