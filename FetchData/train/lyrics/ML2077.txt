And I'll give you a piece
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I'll feel your disease
There's nothing in my dreams
Just some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze
(hey!)
Now if you will be my lover
I will shiver insane
But if you can be my master
I will do anything
There's nothing left to life
But a pair glassy eyes
Raze my feelings one more time
(yeah!)
Find a little strip and find a little stranger
Yeah you're gonna feel my hand
I got a little angel, want a little danger
Honey you're gonna feel my hand
Swear you're gonna feel my hand
Swear you're gonna feel my hand
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Can you feel me?
You gotta feel me!
You gotta feel this
Little stranger...
