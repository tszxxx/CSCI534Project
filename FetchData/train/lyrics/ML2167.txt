has lost all it's meaning
Turn our opinions
into religion
[chorus:]
Ya know, we're killin' each other
Sisters and mothers
Yeah, brother to brother
For a reason or another
We're killin' each other
We're killin' each other
Fight over water
And land the same
Claim we can notice
Even give out a name
[chorus:]
Yeah we're killin' each other
Sisters and Mothers
Brother to brother
for a reason or another
Now we're killin' each other
Yeah killin' each other
Marriage and love
Is now decided by law
How come we judge and abandon
What is given by God
[chorus:]
Yeah, we killin' each other
Sisters and Mothers
Brother to brother
a reason or another
We're killin' each other
We're killin' each other
Brother to brother
for a reason or another
Killin' each other
Yeah, brother to brother
for one reason or another
We killin' each other
Ya know we killin' each other
Yeah we killin' each other
How bout we killin' each other
We killin' each other
