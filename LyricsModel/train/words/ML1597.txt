why can not we go away just speed out 
you just do not want to stay where you aim 
you can not depend and stay all night 
you can not often stay all night 
better say no more woh woh woh woh 
let I free no more 
why can not we wait stay where you haze 
you feel the storm stay where you haze 
you be wait then to start on out 
we can not depend where we stay where you mind 
better way no more woh woh woh woh 
let I free no more 
why can not we go or stay where you mind 
you can depend when you stay where you mind 
well then you go and stray away 
you just do not want to stay where you mind 
better way no more woh woh woh woh 
let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more let I free no more 
let I free no more
