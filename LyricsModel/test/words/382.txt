I will take it by you side . such imagination seem to help the feeling slide . I will take it by you side . Instant correlation suck and breed a pack of lie . I will take it by you side . Oversaturation curl the skin and tans the hide . tick - tock tick - tock tick - tock I be unclean , a libertine and every time you vent you spleen , I seem to lose the power of speech , you slipping slowly from my reach . you grow I like a evergreen , I ... take the plan , spin it sideways . I ... fall . without you , I be nothing . without you , I be nothing . without you , I be nothing . take the plan , spin it sideways .
