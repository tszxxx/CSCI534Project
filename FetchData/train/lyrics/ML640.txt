[Verse 1]
So sick of the hobos
Always begging for change
I don't like how I gotta work
And they just sit around and get paid
I hate all of the people
Who can't drive their cars
Bitch, you better get out of the way
Before I start falling apart
I hate how my wife
Is always up my ass
She always wants to buy brand new things
But I don't have the cash
[Chorus]
I hate my job, all of my rich friends
I hate everyone to the bitter end
Nothing turns out right, there's no end in sight
I hate my life
[Verse 2]
How come I never get laid?
Nice guys always lose
How could she have another headache?
There's always some kind of excuse
I still hate my job, my boss is a dick
I don't get paid nearly enough to put up with all of his shit
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I hate that I can't tell
When a girl's underage
You know, I tell her she's a nice piece of ass
Then her daddy punches me in the face
So, if you're pissed like me
This is what you gotta do
Put your middle fingers up in the air
Go on, and say, "Fuck you!"
[Chorus]
So much at stake, can't catch a break
I hate my life
No, it's nothing new
Hear "it sucks to be you"
I fuckin' hate my life
Fuck!
