there be a lightning storm each and every night 
crash inside you like motorbike 
we toss and turn sleep so loud 
grind the tooth in we empty mouth 
we empty 
there be a forest fire burn bright 
spread quickly towards we last rite 
nowhere to run pointless to hide 
just lay there and scream pretend to try 
pretend 
intend to burn pretend to fight it 
everyone learn faster on fire 
thing take a turn lose all desire 
you live and you burn 
you live and you burn 
this impend doom be leave deep inside 
and it be haunt you each and every night 
like starve wolf count sheep 
we close we eye pretend to sleep 
descend 
intend to burn pretend to fight it 
everyone learn faster on fire 
thing take a turn lose all desire 
you live and you burn you live and 
like hell we be anxiously wait 
like hell burn silently strong 
somehow we fall down by the wayside 
and somehow this hell be home 
as we burn pretend to fight it 
everyone learn faster on fire 
thing take a turn lose all desire 
you live and you burn 
you live and 
like hell we be anxiously wait 
like hell burn silently strong 
somehow we fall down by the wayside 
and somehow this hell be home 
right now this hell be my home
