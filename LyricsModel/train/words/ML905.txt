until the philosophy which hold one race 
Superior and another inferior 
be finally 
and permanently 
discredite 
and abandon 
everywhere be war 
I say war 
that until there be no longer 
first class and second class citizen of any nation 
until the colour of a man 's skin 
be of no more significance than the colour of he eye 
I say war 
that until the basic human rights 
be equally guarantee to all 
without regard to race 
Dis a war 
that until that day 
the dream of last peace 
world citizenship 
rule of international morality 
will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursue 
but never attain 
now everywhere be war 
War

that hold we brother in Angola 
in Mozambique 
South Africa

have be topple 
utterly destroy

war in the west 
war up north 
war down south

rumor of war 
and until that day 
the african continent 
will not know peace 
we Africans will fight we find it necessary 
and we know we shall win 
as we be confident 
in the victory 
of good over evil
