in the sweet old country where I come from 
nobody ever work 
yeah nothing ever get do 
we hang fire we hang fire 
you know marrying money be a full time job 
I do not need the aggravation 
I be a lazy slob 
I hang fire I hang fire 
hang fire put it on the wire 
we have get nothing to eat 
we get nowhere to work 
nothing to drink 
we just lose we shirt 
I be on the dole 
we be not for hire 
say what the hell 
say what the hell hang fire 
hang fire hang fire put it on the wire 
doo doo do of 
take a thousand dollar go have some fun 
put it all on at a hundred to one 
hang fire hang fire put it on the wire
