I can read the write on the wall you pretend that nothing 's change at all I have get just one thing to ask you if it 's so just take you memory with you when you go so I will not have to think about the lonely night I will be without someone to hold I when the cold wind blow take you memory with you when you go I walk the floor and wonder what go wrong I will have to find a way to carry on why do not you leave before the heartache start to show take you memory with you when you go so I will not have to think about the lonely night I will be without someone to hold I when the cold wind blow take you memory with you so I will not have to miss you take you memory with you when you go
