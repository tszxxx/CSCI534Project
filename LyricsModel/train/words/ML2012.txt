verse 1 
Martina Sobara 

I like that outfit the zipper 's pinchin 
but if you want it any tighter we could cinch it 
dress up in leather wear every color 
I be go loco co with sequin in the summer 
so come 
twirl you dress around 
lift you cotton sock on 
and turn you camera on now for the fun 
while I light a fire in you new shoe 
if you should smile look so surprised 
while I light a fire in you new shoe 
look out that you sole do not burn to the floor 
while I light a fire 
I light a fire 
button be bust we be decorate 
we make a ornament with gold and silver plating 
so what be the latest we raise a fever 
we be just all red inside that be all there be to see here 
yeah we be red inside we be all red inside 
and the leg bone be connect to the one in the thigh 
we be red inside we be all red inside 
and the leg bone be connect to the one in the thigh 
so come oh oh oh 
twirl you dress around ound 'ound ound 
lift you cotton sock on on on on on 
turn you camera on oh oh oh oh 
while I light a fire in you new shoe 
if you should smile look so surprised 
while I light a fire in you new shoe 
look out that you sole do not burn to the floor 
while I light a fire in you new shoe 
if you should smile look so surprised 
while I light a fire in you new shoe 
look out that you sole do not burn to the floor 
while I light a fire 
I light a fire
