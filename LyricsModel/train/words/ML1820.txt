I awaken this morning I be fill with despair 
all my dream turn to ashe and go oh yeah 
as I look at my life it be barren and bare 
without love I have have nothing at all 
without love I have have nothing 
without love I have have nothing at all 
I have conquer the world 
all but one thing do I have 
without love I have have nothing at all 
once I have a sweetheart who love only I 
there be nothing oh that she would not give oh no 
but I be blind to she goodness and I could not see 
that a heart without love can not live 
without love I have have nothing 
without love I have have nothing at all 
I have conquer the world 
all but one thing do I have 
without love I have have nothing at all
