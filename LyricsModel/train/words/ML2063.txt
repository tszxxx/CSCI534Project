covenant of pure corruption 
sink my tooth deep into you 
solemn oath of sheer destruction 
nightmare through and through 
in that hour I will devour 
hope be swallow up in pain 
taste the venom feel the power 
course through my vein 
I be corruption 
I be destruction through and through 
trust in I for I will set you free 
with a serpent 's kiss 
with a serpent 's kiss 
be my light and I will not stray make I beg 
make I pray 
tell I when to laugh or cry when to live and when to die 
forget and betrayed 
rotting and decay 
leave to wither without a voice 
leave to slither without a choice 
Crucifier spitting Fire 
say you little empty prayer 
this empire grow higher 
to this spite I swear 
sharp tongue sever like a razor 
swimming in a sea of Rage 
vindicator masqueraders 
all the World 's my stage 
I devour 
I empower God of pain 
trust in I for I will set you free 
with a serpent 's kiss 
how could it come to this 
with a serpent 's kiss
