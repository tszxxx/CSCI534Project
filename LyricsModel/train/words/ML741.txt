I be a stranger in town and my gun 's never cold 
I be a gambler so bet on you life 
you will never live to grow old 
I deal in lead I will not step aside 
where trouble 's waitin well so be I 
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill 
pay in gold for the blood I spill 
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride 
into the west a gun by you side 
Hell and glory honor and pride 
a gun will decide where the outlaw ride 
the law of the west be the law of the gun 
shoot and be fast life on the run 
stay alive be fast on the draw 
live by the gun or die by the law 
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride 
into the west a gun by you side 
Hell and glory honor and pride 
a gun will decide where the outlaw ride 
shot trough the heart in the blink of a eye 
bury up on boot hill 
life be cheap when the bounty be high 
so be ready to kill 
the law of the west be the law of the gun 
shoot and be fast life on the run 
stay alive be fast on the draw 
live by the gun or die by the law 
shot of whiskey I will be on my way 
back in the saddle pull on the rein 
Spurs to the beast over the hill 
another town one more kill 
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride 
into the west a gun by you side 
Hell and glory honor and pride 
a gun will decide where the outlaw ride
