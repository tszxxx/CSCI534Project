London Calling
Guns Of Brixton
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shut down on the pavement
Or waiting in dead row
You can crash us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh - the guns of Brixton
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven as in hell
You see he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivan
At the end of The harder they come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodby to the Brixton sun
You can crash us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shut us
But Oh - the guns of Brixton
