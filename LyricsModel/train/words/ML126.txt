in my life 
I have feel so self assure 
but suddenly it be all change 
she be a cloud 
that hang above my world 
and I find myself wander in the rain 
and now I can not go on 
cause I be lose 
live inside myself 
live inside this shell 
live outside you love 
I be lose 
somewhere inside my own dream 
afraid of what life really mean 
live without you love 
I need she guide light 
to shine on my darkest day 
I be young and time be on my side 
but like a fool I let it slip away 
and now those day be go 
and I be lose 
live inside myself 
live inside this shell 
live outside you love 
I be lose 
somewhere inside my own dream 
afraid of what life really mean 
live without you love 
in my life 
I have feel so self assure 
but oh how the season change 
and now I be not that strong 
cause I be lose 
live inside myself 
live inside this hell 
live outside you love 
I be lose 
somewhere inside my own dream 
afraid of what life really mean 
live without you love 
I be lose 
live inside myself 
live inside this shell 
live outside you love 
I be lose
