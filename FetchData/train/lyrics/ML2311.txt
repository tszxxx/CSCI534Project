[Verse 1]
Meet me over in the city
And I see everything is so fine
We'll get together now, darling
Oh yeah, we will
We'll make everything all right
Oh honey, don't
Oh honey, don't
Please, please don't leave me right now, girl
Right now, right now, oh no no
[Verse 2]
You got me, baby
You got me, girl
You got me where you want me, baby
Oh well
Now girl, I know you are satisfied
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I think I will, baby
And then again my my mind'll change
It tells me don't do it no more
Sometimes I think I will
And then again my my mind'll change
It tells me don't do it no more
Yes, but I'm still begging you, baby
Please, please don't leave me right now, girl
Right now, right now
Oh, no no
