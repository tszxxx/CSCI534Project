I have be walk in the rain 
just to get wet on purpose 
I have be force myself not to forget 
just to feel worse 
Pre chorus Bernard Sumner and 
Neil Tennant 

I have be get away with it all my life 

get away 

however I look it be clear to see 
that I love you more than you love I 
however I look it be clear to see 
I love you more than you love I 
I hate that mirror 
it make I feel so worthless 
I be a original sinner but when I be with you 
I could not care less 
Pre chorus Bernard Sumner and 
Neil Tennant 

I have be get away with it all my life 

get away with it 

get away with it all my life 

get away 

however I look it be clear to see 
that I love you more than you love I 
however I look it be clear to see 
that I love you more than you love I 
I love you more than you love I 
more than you love I 
bridge Bernard Sumner 
and Neil Tennant 

I think I give up fall in love 
a long long time ago 
I guess I like it but I can not tell you 
you should not really know 
and it be be true 
all my life 
yes it be be true 
all my life 
verse 3 Bernard Sumner 
and Neil Tennant 

I have be talk to myself 
just to suggest that I be selfish 

get ahead 

I have be try to impress 
that more be less and I be repressed 

I should do what he say 

however I look it be clear to see 
that I love you more than you love I 
however I look it be clear to see 
that I love you more than you love I 
I love you more than you love I 
I love you more than you love I 
get away with it 
get away with it
