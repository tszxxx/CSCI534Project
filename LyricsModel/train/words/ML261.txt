Un deux trois oh oh

bang bang bang

one by one by one no more skylarking 
around my head 
you information 
but there be no hiding behind moulting feather 
on the plane on my brain bout to do the show 
40 k contract take get out the door 
dice symbolise my life roll them on the floor 
from you grubby hand as you ham and grandstand 
you live a shitty life 
we live the bon bon vie 
you hide it in the book while we watch the tv 
think you get we fool who never again 
first time shame on I second time you time will end 
no way bang you be dead paint you silhouette 
Je the plumerai la tête 
Je the plumerai la tête 
bang you be dead alouette paint you silhouette 
Je the plumerai la tête 
Je the plumerai la tête 
no way no the clock be tick forward 
no way it be just a cruel cruel world 
cruel world be fittin' they get we all hidden 
with late night division and lab rat incision 
but face with decision to fight or fricasse 
and you clearly decide on how to handle I 
difficile imbecile be it fake be it real 
be we dyin on we foot be we tryin in we sleep 
there be a rumor goin round bout the suit runnin town 
if you look into the sky dead bird fly high high high 
number you fly by number 
you be log hour and do not see the big picture 
over you shoulder you will get no last word 
because it be too late you have clip you own wing 
no way bang you be dead paint you silhouette 
Je the plumerai la tête 
Je the plumerai la tête 
bang you be dead alouette paint you silhouette 
Je the plumerai la tête 
Je the plumerai la tête
