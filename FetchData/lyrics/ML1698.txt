[Intro]
Here we go!
[Verse 1]
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same Dear
If you're not here with me
[Verse 2]
And when the blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
[Break]
Oh no no no
[Verse 3]
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Well it won't be the same Dear
If you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
(Blue Christmas, blue blue Christmas)
That's when those blue memories start calling
(Blue Christmas, blue blue Christmas)
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
[Outro]
Baby, I'll have a blue blue Christmas
Oh so very blue
