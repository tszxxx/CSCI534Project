I do not take to analysis 
so I have to make up my mind 
and hold it for awhile 
I would not just leave you without a kiss 
but I guess there must come a time 
when there be no more tear to cry 
bee and snake need home 
barricade 
it start to feel like a barricade 
to keep we away to keep we away 
and it kinda do 
start to feel like a barricade 
to keep we away keep we away 
I could not lean on the politics 
cause I do not want to train my eye 
to hold so short a time 
also 
I just do not know where the blind could lead the sightless 
but 
I still like to witness 
bee and snake need home 
barricade 
it start to feel like a barricade 
to keep we away to keep we away 
and it kinda do 
start to feel like a barricade 
to keep we away keep we away 
full speed half blind 
full tilt decline 
return to past time 
full speed half blind 
sometimes it feel like a barricade 
to keep we away keep we away 
and it kinda do 
and how much fear can you fabricate to keep we away 
when you know we 
full speed half blind 
full tilt decline 
we turn to past time 
full speed half blind 
full speed half blind 
full tilt decline 
on to old time 
full speed half blind
