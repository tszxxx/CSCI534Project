[Intro]
Yeah you know, Rasta live
Universal sign of love
Love is the answer my friend
And love is the only way
[Verse 1: Jah Cure]
Yeah, true love you can find yourself
And call a true identities
Love your brother, love your sister
Love one another the universal sign
I'll take it from here
[Hook]
Love is much more to life than just words
Love means much more than to say you love
Love is call on me brother
Love is call on me sister
[Verse 2: Jah Cure]
When you love someone, love from the heart
Cause love is the start, yeah
Love is the answer for every question
Just ask yourself why, why?
Love is the key to open the door
When they close in your face
Love shows you the way when you are lost, lost
And can't find your way
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Jah Cure]
Love is the only thing we have to share
Don't you forget that I hope you hear
Sending my message to you out there
I hope you get it clear, yeah
Do not mistake me
And mistake every sound
Whenever you see my face
Always a smile contracts a frown
