before this dance be through 
I think I will love you too 
I be so happy when you dance with I 
I do not want to kiss or hold you hand 
if it be funny try and understand 
there be really nothing else I would rather do 
cause I be happy just to dance with you 
I do not need to hug or hold you tight 
I just want to dance with you all night 
in this world there be nothing I would rather do 
cause I be happy just to dance with you 
just to dance with you 
be everything I need 
before this dance be through 
I think I will love you too 
I be so happy when you dance with I 
if somebody try to take my place 
let 's pretend we just can not see he face 
in this world there be nothing I would rather do 
cause I be happy just to dance with you 
just to dance with you 
be everything I need 
before this dance be through 
I think I will love you too 
I be so happy when you dance with I 
if somebody try to take my place 
let 's pretend we just can not see he face 
in this world there be nothing I would rather do 
I have discover I be in love with you
