a dream 
a simple fantasy 
that I 
wish be reality 
that you 
come knock at my door 
and we 
relive this dream once more 
last night I dream 
that you be here with I 
and we be in each other 's arm 
it be oh so heavenly 
you hold I close to you 
and whisper in my ear 
let 's spend the night together 
share love beyond the bed 
as we dance to the melody 
we have so much to share 
and the music stop 
in a flash I be all alone 
it be just a dream 
haunt I once again 
a dream 
a simple fantasy 
that I 
wish be reality 
that you 
come knock at my door 
and we 
relive this dream once more 
the day you leave 
you say you would return 
just when you could not promise 
that you need some time alone 
you say you would love I 
and someday we love would be 
I could not understand it 
I think we be both happy 
as we dance to the melody 
we have so much to share 
then the music stop 
in a flash I be all alone 
it be just a dream 
haunt I once again oh 
a dream 
a simple fantasy 
that I 
wish be reality 
that you 
come knock at my door 
and we 
relive this dream once more 
a dream 
a simple fantasy 
that I 
wish be reality 
that you 
come knock at my door 
and we 
relive this dream once more 
oh a dream 
a simple fantasy 
that I 
wish be reality 
that you 
come knock at my door 
and we 
relive this dream once more 
a dream 
a simple fantasy 
that I 
wish be reality 
that you 
come knock at my door 
and we 
relive this dream once more
