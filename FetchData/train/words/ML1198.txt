it 's the same old song you gotta be somewhere at sometime and they never let you fly it 's like break glass you get cut before you see it so open up you eye you get desire so let it out you get the power Stand up and shout shout , stand up and shout you get wing of steel but they never really move you you only seem to crawl you have be nail to the wheel but never really turn you know you get to work it out you get desire so let it out you get the power Stand up and shout shout , stand up and shout let it out you be the strongest chain and you be not just some reflection so never hide again you be the driver you own the road you be the fire go on , explode you get desire so let it out you get the power Stand up and shout Stand up and shout let it out Stand up and shout
