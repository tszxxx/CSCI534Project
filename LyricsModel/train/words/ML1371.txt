do not guess I have ever love another 
never once before do I really see the light 
cause they be barely friend and merely lover 
and it be take what you have give I to feel like I do tonight 
I be move by the spirit 
I be here to testify 
I find a amen kind of love 
the kind that make you fall down on you knee 
and reach for the sky above 
the kind that you soul just can not never get enough 
I find a amen a amen a amen kind of love 
you have give love a brand new meaning 
bound by a higher power than I have ever know before 
safe in you faithful arm I be lean 
once I be lose but now I be find forevermore 
and I be move by the spirit 
I be here to testify 
I find a amen kind of love 
the kind that make you fall down on you knee 
and reach for the sky above 
the kind that you soul just can not never get enough 
I find a amen a amen a amen kind of love 
we be move by the spirit 
we be here to testify 
we have find a amen kind of love 
the kind that make you fall down on you knee 
and reach for the sky above 
the kind that you soul just can not never get enough 
we have find a amen a amen a amen kind of love
