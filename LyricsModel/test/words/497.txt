Steals across the meadow of my heart high up in the sky the little star climb always remind I that we be apart you wander down the lane and far away leave I a song that will not die love be now the stardust of yesterday the music of the year go by . sometimes I wonder , how I spend the lonely night dream of a song the melody haunt my reverie and I be once again with you when we love be new and each kiss a inspiration but that be long ago and now my consolation be in the stardust of a song besides the garden wall , when star be bright you be in my arm the nightingale tell he fairytale of paradise , where rose grow though I dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of love 's refrain . min_words_error : " max_words_error : " Cheeeek
