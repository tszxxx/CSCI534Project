I see she sit in the rain 
raindrop fall on she 
she do not seem to care 
she sit there and smil at I 
then I know 
she could make I happy 
Flowers in she hair 
Flowers everywhere 
oh I do not know just why 
she simply catch my eye 
she seem so sweet and kind 
she creep into my mind 
I know I have to say hello 
she smil up at I 
and she take my hand 
and we walk through the park alone 
and I know 
she have make I happy 
Flowers in she hair 
Flowers everywhere 
oh I do not know just why 
she simply catch my eye 
she seem so sweet and kind 
she creep into my mind 
suddenly the sun break through 
I turn around she be go 
and all I have leave 
be one little flower in my hand 
but I know 
she have make I happy 
Flowers in she hair 
Flowers everywhere 
be she reality 
or just a dream to I 
she love show I the way 
to find a sunny day 
be she reality 
or just a dream to I
