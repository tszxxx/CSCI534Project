little girl do not you understand 
I want to be you lovin man 
all by myself all by myself 
I do not need no one to love you 
gonna love you all by myself 
well meet I in a hurry behind the barn 
do not be afraid I will do you no harm 
all by myself all by myself 
I do not need no one to love you 
gonna love you all by myself 
well I get a girl who be six foot tall 
sleep in the kitchen with she foot in the hall 
all by myself all by myself 
I do not need no one to love she

well I get a girl who live on the hill 
she will not love you but she sister will 
all by herself all by herself 
I do not need no one to love you 
gonna love you all by herself
