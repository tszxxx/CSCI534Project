[Verse 1]
I was a sailor first, I sailed the sea
Then I got a job in a factory
Played 
Butlin's Camp
 with my friend 
Rory
It was good for him, it was great for me
[Chorus]
Liverpool I left you, said goodbye to 
Madryn Street
I always followed my heart and I never missed a beat
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down
[Verse 2]
Went to 
Hamburg
, the red lights were on
With George and Paul, and my friend John
We rocked all night, we all looked tough
We didn't have much, but we had enough
[Chorus]
Liverpool I left you, said goodbye to 
Madryn Street
I always followed my heart and I never missed a beat
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down
[Verse 3]
In the U.S.A. when we played 
Shea
We were number one and it was fun
When I look back, it sure was cool
For those four boys from Liverpool
[Chorus]
Liverpool I left you, said goodbye to Admiral Grove
I always followed my heart, so I took it on the road
Destiny was calling, I just couldnâ€™t stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down
[Outro]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Liverpool
Liverpool
Liverpool
Liverpool, come On
Liverpool
Liverpool, come on lads
Liverpool, let me hear it
(Liverpool) One more time
Liverpool
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Liverpool
