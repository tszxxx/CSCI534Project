I forget more than you will ever know about she you think you know the smile on she lip the thrill and the touch of she fingertip but I forget more than you will ever know about she you think you will find heaven of bliss in each caress , in each tender kiss but I forget more than you will ever know about she you steal she love from I one day you do not care how it hurt I but you can never steal away memory of what use to be you think she 's yours , to have and to hold Someday you will learn , when she love grow cold but I forget more than you will ever know about she
