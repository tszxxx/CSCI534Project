[Intro Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
I know that love, love is found
Love is found
[Verse 1]
I cut the radio on
I know it wonâ€™t be long
I can hear you baby
I can feel your sound
I'm putting closer now
Now like I feel the sound
[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
And I know that love, love is found
Love is found
[Refrain]
Oh, and my heart go ba-boom-ba-boom
Ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom-boom
My heart go ba-boom-ba-boom
[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
And I know that love, love is found
Love is found
[Refrain]
Oh, and my heart go ba-boom-ba-boom
Ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom-boom
My heart go ba-boom-ba-boom
[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
And I know that love, love is found
Love is found
