[Verse 1]
Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge on
Balancing on a ledge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
[Chorus]
The evil that men do lives on and on
(4x)
[Verse 2]
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain
, 
the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
[Chorus]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
[Chorus]
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
