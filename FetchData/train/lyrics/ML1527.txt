And you know I can't hold on
'Cause I can't miss you while you go
All these years I've cried and you know I've tried
You never lived out the way that you like
And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget
If you walk out don't look back
Don't ever be at what we had
And I'm not sorry but I can't forget
You left me bitter by the things you said
And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget
And you know I can't hold on
'Cause I can't miss you while you go
All these years I've cried and you know I've tried
You never lived out the way that you like
And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget
If you walk out don't look back
Don't ever be at what we had
And I'm not sorry but I can't forget
You left me bitter by the things you said
And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget
