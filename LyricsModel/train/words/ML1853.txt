I take she out on a February morning 
just get over it and deal with the mourn 
I start think out loud 
I be so sick and tired of be sick and tired 
my baby 's fly off the edge of the rope 
she be say I be so sorry about that note 
that leave I all alone 
but I be so sick and tired of be sick and tired 
somebody turn the light on 
somebody tell I what be wrong 
I would be lie if I tell you 
lose you be something I could handle 
somebody turn the light on 
somebody tell I how long 
all this darkness will surround you 
cause I be burn for you 
burn like a candle 
Seven day since I have see you face 
Seven night I have lay to waste 
I be burn out now 
I be sick and tired of be sick and tired 
I know we be hang at the end of the road 
we have fly too high baby swum too low 
I hear she scream out loud 
I hear she scream out loud 
somebody turn the light on 
somebody tell I what be wrong 
I would be lie if I tell you 
lose you be something I could handle 
somebody turn the light on 
somebody tell I how long 
all this darkness will surround you 
cause I be burn for you 
burn like a candle 
baby baby baby 
all the thing that you say 
what be the thing that you mean 
what be the thing that you say say say to I 
cause you be a tragedy 
a queen for he majesty 
all these plan for I 
you kingdom be crumble 
you be a tragedy 
a queen for he majesty 
all these plan for I 
you kingdom be crumble 
somebody turn the light on 
somebody tell I what be wrong 
I would be lie if I tell you 
lose you be something I could handle 
somebody turn the light on 
somebody tell I how long 
all this darkness will surround you 
cause I be burn for you 
burn like a candle 
burn for you 
burn like a candle 
burn for you 
burn like a candle
