fate silent warrior sleep soul will arise 
once forget soldier come to life 
fall mercenary dormancy be do 
not content with war we never will and 
memory can not ignore 
anguish of before 
satisfy the scorn 
rise ghost of war 
target assassinate time of you life have expire 
hatred victimize gaze in they eye as they die 
violence inflicting of pain savage mortician deny 
drive the salt in the wound arouse the subconscious to lie 
memory can not ignore 
anguish of before 
satisfy the scorn 
rise ghost of war 
I deal in pain 
all life I drain 
I dominate 
I seal you fate 
I deal in pain 
all life I drain 
memory can not ignore 
rise ghost of war
