Hey, the roof is leakin' and the rain's fallin' on my head, it won't stop
The roof is leakin' and the rain's fallin' on my head, I need a mop
I cried so hard, teardrops on my bed, drippity-drop (yes)
She packed up her bags and she moved out on the midnight train (drip drip) she's
Got no brain (drippity-drop)
She packed up her bag and she moved out on the midnight train, (drip drip) the
Girl's insane (drippity-drop)
