wooo yeah 
as poor as I be I have get my ambition 
keep my distance from war and contention 
I might not be rich but I sure get style 
get some good friend 
but still some who hate I 
tell they lie 
and still that do not quake I 
the joy that be inside 
bring out my healthy smile 
try if you want 
can not stop I 
lie if you want 
still will not move I 
will not move I 
nooo 
will not move I at all 
I know who I be 
I do not let nobody 
underestimate I and you will end up sorry 
the father will humble you like a child 
oh yeah 
I be get stronger 
so much stronger 
day by day 
I be get stronger 
so much stronger 
can not move I 
can not move I 
nooo 
try if you want 
can not stop I 
lie if you want 
still will not move I 
will not move I 
nooo 
will not move I at all 
amidst all the pressure 
I have still get to make it 
always push 
the sky be my limit 
so keep you idle talk 
I do not have the time 
there be so much in life 
if you be willing to earn it 
I will give you some of mine 
but please do not stress it 
awake from the slumber 
open up you eye 
try if you want 
can not stop I 
lie if you want 
still will not move I 
will not move I 
nooo 
will not move I at all 
I be get stronger 
so much stronger 
and you can not move I no 
poor as I be I have get my ambition 
keep my distance from war and contention 
I might not be rich but I sure get style 
get some good friend 
but still some who hate I 
tell they lie 
and still that do not quake I 
the joy that be inside 
bring out my healthy smile 
try if you want 
can not stop I 
lie if you want 
still will not move I 
will not move I 
nooo
