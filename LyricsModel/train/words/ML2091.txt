I could take every fuck word she say 
throw it in she face 
but would she even care 
I still remember when she look at I 
that fry upon she face 
try to be sincere 
I gather all those little thing she say 
keep they close to I 
try to make this real 
this cloud will always hover over I 
I be leave you today 
cause now I see 
suffocate you suffocate 
that you lie 
that you be fake 
suffocate you suffocate 
you always take 
what you can and 
I could take every fuck game you play 
blow it all away 
but would you even care 
I could take all those lie you say to I 
never go away 
never disappear 
this cloud will always hover over I 
I be leave you today 
cause now I see 
now I be far away from you 
I will never bring back yesterday 
you be such a fake it be true 
I can not believe the word you say 
I be far away from you 
I will never bring back yesterday 
I always take 
what I can and
