[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fight
Sometimes I cry
Why don't I just tell him goodbye?
Sometimes I should
But sometimes I don't
Build up the strength to say that it's wrong
Sometimes I hate
Sometimes I love
Sometimes I hurt
Sometimes I don't
Sometimes I wait for him to change
But it's okay
I just got to pay (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't ever wanna leave 'em alone
They say I'm brainwashed, but I'm in love with this man (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Keep telling myself that it's not worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare
So when will I wake up and scream?
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare, perfect nightmare
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I keep it cool
Sometimes I let 'em know
Sometimes I even pack my bags to walk out the door
Sometimes I feel safe
Sometimes I really don't
Sometimes I promise that I'm ready to let 'em go
[Pre-Chorus:]
But I don't ever wanna leave 'em alone
They say I'm brainwashed, but I'm in love with this man
Ohh, ohh
[Chorus]
Keep telling myself that it's not worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare
So when will I wake up and scream?
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare, perfect nightmare
[Bridge]
Hoping he's changing
But I'm scared he's not
Can't see a way to leave him
He opened my eyes
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
Keep telling myself that it's not worth it (Keep telling myself)
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare, perfect, yeah
Keep telling myself that it's not worth it (No way, no way)
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare (Perfect nightmare)
So when will I wake up and scream?
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare, perfect nightmare
[Outro]
No way, no way, no way (N-n-n-no)
No way, no way, no way (N-n-n-n-no)
No way (N-n-n-no)
But if it's from you, I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare, perfect nightmare
(Perfect nightmare)
