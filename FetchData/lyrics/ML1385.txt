[Verse 1]
I can hear you sighing
Saying you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
[Verse 2]
On the beach we're sitting
Hugging, squeezing, kissing
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams
[Bridge]
When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy
[Verse 3]
Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams
[Harmonica solo]
[Bridge]
When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy
[Verse 4]
Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
