one by one they be turn out the light 
I have be feedin that ol jukebox just to hold you tight 
I guess it be for the best I just put in my last dime 
I hear you whisper we will meet again another place another time 
chair be stack all over table it be close time they say 
I could wait right here forever if they would only let I stay 
anywhere would be much better than lonley room of mine 
throug a lonely night a waitin for 
another place another time 
will not that room of mine be a lonely place to be 
I have be so use to hold you close to I 
will not that old stairway be hard to climb 
to a lonley room wait for another place another time 
will not that old stairway be hard to climb 
to a lonely room to wait for 
another place another time
