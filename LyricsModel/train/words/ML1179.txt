I be scared to try cause I be scared to fail 
I be scared to die cause I be scared of hell 
I be scared to kiss scared to hug 
I be scared of sex cause I be scared to touch 
I be scared to look cause I be scared to see 
I be scared of you cause I be scared of I 
I be scared to fly cause I be scared to crash 
I be scared to move on so I live in the past 
I be scared to fight cause I be scared to bleed 
I be scared of love cause I be scared he will live 
I be scared of drug I be scared to drink 
I be scared to swim cause I be scared to sink 
I be scared to learn cause I be scared of truth 
do not want to gain weight cause I be scared of food 
I be scared to think that the label drop I 
I be scared to think of my album floppin 
this may sound silly but it be true 
so do not pretend it be not you too 
we all afraid of something here 
cuz you be not human with out fear 
I be scared to start cause I be scared I will quit 
I be scared that people will not like my shit 
I be scared of fame and paparazzi 
rumor startin and people watch 
scared to grow up cause I be scared to get old 
scared of the dark and be alone 
I be scared of war I be scared of jail 
scared to share a secret cause I be scared you will tell 
this may sound silly but it be true 
so do not pretend it be not you too 
we all afraid of something here 
cuz you be not human with out fear
