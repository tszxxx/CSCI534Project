There was a little spanish flea
A record star he thought he'd be
He heard of singers like Beatles
And The Chipmunks he'd seen on TV
Why not a little spanish flea?
And so he hid
Inside a doggie from madrid
He arrived in the city
Still singin his sweet harmony
As proud as any flea could be
He walked around
As if he owned the town
Humming his pint sized melody
With his guitar he knew he'd be a star
And in his own home town, how proud he'd be
Then all at once he met a man
Who said, "I'll help you if i can"
He listened close to his song
And then he sang right along for you see
He loved that little spanish flea
