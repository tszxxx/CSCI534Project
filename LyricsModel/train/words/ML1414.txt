turn the scissors with open blade 
all the darkness will burn 
recall picture of olden day 
all these feeling return 
if you be breathe you have be afraid 
in the shadow remain 
I will be stalk you night and day 
till you share all my pain 
now we step into the fire 
beware you will pay 
Ladykiller 
I swear you will pay 
Ladykiller 
bait the killer and lie in wait 
till the morning unfold 
now he be feed on my mistake 
and the trail have run cold 
all the violence that fill the world 
leave nothing for shame 
this be when so much pain will call out 
such thing I have learn 
hear my vow and fear my vengeance 
beware you will pay 
Ladykiller 
I swear you will pay 
Ladykiller
