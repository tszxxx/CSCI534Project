whenever sky look gray to I and trouble begin to brow whenever the winter wind become too strong I concentrate on you when fortune cry " Nay , nay " to I and people declare " you be through " whenever the bly become my only song I concentrate on you on you smile , so sweet , so tender when at first my kiss you do decline on the light in you eye when you surrender and once again we arm intertwine and so when wise man say to I that love 's young dream never come true to prove that even the wise man can be wrong I concentrate on you
