bear from the fire clean 
crawl in the dirt like war 
5 year 
my mother give a voice for war 
10 I be dead 
bear again with eye for war 
by 15 
hate be the name of my war 
wash I in the river 
give I to the pain of LifeWar 
LifeWar 
20 year go 
and father tell I life be like war 
hand to the bone 
25 year of war 
30 
I wake to the sound of soul at war 
I will pass through 
bury with the flag of my war 
wash I in the river 
give I to the pain of LifeWar 
LifeWar
