do you pick the wrong one 
do he break you heart 
he start act crazy 
when you want to part 
he leave some scar on you face 
and bruise you grace with friend 
it will be okay 
the lonely one be here 
do you pick the wrong one 
confused you with he smile 
trick you with he letter 
and he fancy style 
he push a ring on you 
before you know 
you be isolate now 
it will be okay 
the lonely one be here 
oh the lonely one be here 
you be not just mean to wait it out 
be patient until he figure it out 
he ought to know the obvious 
girl that you be you be so marvelous 
he ask some question of love 
that you answer long ago 
do he care for you I do not know 
but I wish you I wish you let let it go 
it will be okay the lonely one be here 
oh the lonely one be here 
do you pick the wrong one 
do you pick the wrong one 
the wrong one
