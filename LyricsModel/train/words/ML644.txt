ooh 
another day have almost come and go 
can not imagine what else could wrong 
sometimes I have like to hide away somewhere and lock the door 
a single battle lose but not the war 
cause tomorrow 's another day 
and I be thirsty anyway 
so bring on the rain 
verse 2 Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw 

it be almost like the hard time circle round 
a couple drop and they all start come down 
yeah I might feel defeat 
I might hang my head 
I might be barely breathe 
but I be not dead 
chorus Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw 

cause 
tomorrow 's another day 
and I be thirsty anyway 
so bring on the rain 
bridge Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw 

no 
I be not go to let it get I down 
I be not go to cry 
and I be not go to lose any sleep tonight 
cause tomorrow 's another day 
and I be not afraid 
so bring on the rain 
chorus Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw 

tomorrow 's another day 
and I be thirsty anyway 
so bring on the rain 
outro Jo Dee Messina and 
Tim McGraw 
and 
both 

ooh 
bring on bring on the rain 
no I be 
not go to let it get I dow and 
I be not go to cry 
so bring on the rain 
ay-e-ay-e-ain 

ooh 
bring on bring on the rain 
bring on the rain 
rain 

bring on the rain 
bring on the rain 
ooh
