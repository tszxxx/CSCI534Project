[Verse 1: Bernard Sumner]
I've been walking in the rain
Just to get wet on purpose
I've been forcing myself not to forget
Just to feel worse
[Pre-Chorus: Bernard Sumner and 
Neil Tennant
 ]
I've been getting away with it all my life
(
Getting away
)
[Chorus: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
I love you more than you love me
[Verse 2: Bernard Sumner]
I hate that mirror
It makes me feel so worthless
I'm an original sinner but when I'm with you
I couldn't care less
[Pre-Chorus: Bernard Sumner and 
Neil Tennant
 ]
I've been getting away with it all my life
(
Getting away with it
)
Getting away with it all my life
(
Getting away
)
[Chorus: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me
More than you love me
[Bridge: Bernard Sumner 
and Neil Tennant
]
I thought I gave up falling in love
A long long time ago
I guess I like it but I can't tell you
You shouldn't really know
And it's been true
All my life
Yes, it's been true
All my life
[Verse 3: Bernard Sumner 
and Neil Tennant
]
I've been talking to myself
Just to suggest that I'm selfish
(
Getting ahead
)
I've been trying to impress
That more is less and I'm repressed
(
I should do what he said
)
[Chorus: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me
[Outro: Neil Tennant]
Getting away with it
Getting away with it
