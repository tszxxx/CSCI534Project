[Intro]
Seri, Seri, Seri, Serani!
[Bridge]
Everywhere I go they find me
Hypocrites and badmind
Every, every, every, every
Everywhere I go there's envy
Backstabbers and parasites
[Chorus]
Some, some, somebody tell me what they want from me!
Me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fighting for a cause, a me them can't pause
Yeah, me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fightin for a cause, because
[Verse 1]
Because' you know it's everywhere, evil in the atmosphere
Things catching
Righteous, please beware
We dem watching, chit-chatting
It's clear they're so envious of my flare
By the power in me and the help of the Father
Serani, never fear another
I'm a live up, never give up, chose the ripper
[Chorus]
Somebody tell me what they want from me!
Me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fighting for a cause, a me them can't pause
Yeah, me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fightin for a cause, because
[Verse 2]
For me, the fassy dem a plan
Dem a go lose the battle 'cause Almighty a mi Don
Me conscience free 'cause me never do no wrong
A music me make, write, and sing song
Remember I said you can see it in their face
We know the genuine ones from the fakes
Judge them by the way them embrace
Such disgrace...
[Chorus]
Somebody tell me what they want from me!
Me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fighting for a cause, a me them can't pause
Yeah, me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fightin for a cause, because

Everywhere I go they find me
Hypocrites and badmind
Every, every, every, every
Everywhere I go there's envy
Backstabbers and parasites
[Chorus]
Some, some, somebody tell me what they want from me!
Me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
I'm fighting for a cause, a me them can't pause
Yeah, me say, you can't study people
Dem same people a study bere evil
But, good over evil, me see say dem feeble
