I can not escape this hell 
so many time I have try 
but I be still cage inside 
somebody get I through this nightmare 
I can not control myself 
so what if you can see the darkest side of I 
no one will ever change this animal I have become 
help I believe it be not the real I 
somebody help I tame this animal 
I can not escape myself 
so many time I have lie 
but there be still rage inside 
somebody get I through this nightmare 
I can not control myself 
so what if you can see the darkest side of I 
no one will ever change this animal I have become 
help I believe it be not the real I 
somebody help I tame this animal I have become 
help I believe it be not the real I 
somebody help I tame this animal 
somebody help I through this nightmare 
I can not control myself 
somebody wake I from this nightmare 
I can not escape this hell 
this animal 
this animal 
this animal 
this animal 
this animal 
this animal 
this animal 
so what if you can see the darkest side of I 
no one will ever change this animal I have become 
help I believe it be not the real I 
somebody help I tame this animal I have become 
help I believe it be not the real I 
somebody help I tame this animal 
this animal I have become
