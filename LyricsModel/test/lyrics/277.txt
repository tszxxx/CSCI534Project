[Intro: Sting]
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
[Drum &amp; Guitar Solos - 1:10-2:04]
[Verse 1: Mark Knopfler]
Now look at them yo-yo's, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin,' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
[Chorus: Mark Knopfler &amp; Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Verse 2: Mark Knopfler]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire
[Chorus: Mark Knopfler &amp; Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Ad Lib: Mark Knopfler]
Hoover mover
Uh
[Chorus: Sting &amp; 
Mark Knopfler
]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries, we got
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Ad Lib: Knopfler]
Looky here, look out
[Verse 3: Mark Knopfler &amp; Sting]
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin', 
that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free
[Chorus: Mark Knopfler &amp; Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Outro: Mark Knopfler, 
Sting

Both

Listen here
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin'
That's the way you do it
Money for nothin', and your chicks for free
Money for nothin',  and chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get your money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin'
Yeah
Chicks for free
What's that?
Get your money for nothin', chicks for free
Look at that, look at that
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Bozos
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Ah, money for nothin'
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money for nothin'
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Easy, easy
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money for nothin'
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
That ain't workin'
[Guitar Solo - 6:52-8:01]
[Outro: Sting]
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
