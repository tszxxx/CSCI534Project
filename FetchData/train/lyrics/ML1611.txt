for the rainbow's covered my view
Again I turn around and there's another rainbow coming from you
But it won't be long 'til I get home
To see in your eyes and discover
(what do) they know what you go through
You bring the sun, I brought the water, 
brought the rainbows still coming from you
But it won't be long 'til I get home
Rainbows
But it won't be long
But it won't be long
But it won't be long
