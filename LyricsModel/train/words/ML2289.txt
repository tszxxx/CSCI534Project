Hush little baby 
do not you cry 
when we get to Tucson 
you will see why 
we leave the snowstorm 
and the thunder and rain 
for the desert sun 
we be go to be bear again 
what be important 
in this world 
a little boy 
a little girl 
hush little darling 
go to sleep 
look out the window 
and count the sheep 
that dot the hillside 
in the field of wheat 
across America 
as we cross America 
what be important 
here today 
the broken line 
on the highway 
all the love in the world for you girl 
Thumbelina in a great big scary world 
all the love in the world for you girl 
take my hand and we will make it through this world 
Hush little baby 
my poor little thing 
you have be shuffle about 
like a pawn wedding ring 
it must seem strange 
love be here then go 
and the Oklahoma sunrise 
become the Amarillo daw and 
what be important 
in this life 
ask the man 
who be lose he wife
