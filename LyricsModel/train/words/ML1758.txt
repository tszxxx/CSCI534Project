you shatter I 
you grip on I a hold on I so dull it kill 
you stifle I 
infectious sense of hopelessness and prayer for rain 
I suffocate 
I breathe in dirt and nowhere shine but desolate and drab 
the hour all spend on kill time again all wait for the rain 
you fracture I 
you hand on I a touch so plain so stale it kill 
you strangle I 
entangle I in hopelessness and prayer for rain 
I deteriorate 
I live in dirt and nowhere glow but drearily and tired 
the hour all spend on kill time again all wait for the rain 
you fracture I 
you hand on I a touch so plain so stale it kill 
you strangle I 
entangle I in hopelessness and prayer for rain 
prayer for rain
