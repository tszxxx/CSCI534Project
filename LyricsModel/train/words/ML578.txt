break down one by one 
they will take you pride and crush it 
the fall that come be real by pure degradation 
amputate humiliate 
who can take this punishment 
create something new 
a warrior where there once be nothing 
destroy the body and mind 
behold the spirit can survive 
destroy the body and mind 
today be a good day to die 
face down in the sand 
Spirit rise 
destruction come only once in a lifetime 
can not be great in you mind 
this be the time to say you last prayer 
if you desire peace then prepare for war 
destroy the body and mind 
behold the spirit can survive 
destroy the body and mind 
today be a good day to die 
destroy the body and mind 
behold the spirit can survive 
destroy the body and mind 
I be ready for mine 
face down in the sand 
Spirit rise 
face down in the sand 
Spirit rise 
prepare for war rise 
prepare for war and rise
