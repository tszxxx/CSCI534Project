where can you be 
I wait patiently 
my heart cry out 
pain inside 
where can you be 
I wait patiently 
when you be alone 
go get rough 
come back come back come back baby 
I have have enoug 
make I queen 
happy again

and ease my pain 
when you be alone 
go get rough 
come back come back come back baby 
I have have enough 
make I queen 
happy again 
hear I cry 
ease my pain
