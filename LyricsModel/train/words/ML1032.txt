because of you there be a song in my heart 
because of you my romance have it 's start 
because of you the sun will shine 
the moon and star will say you be mine 
forever and never to part 
I only live for you love and you kiss 
it be paradise to be near you like this 
because of you my life be now worthwhile 
and I can smile because of you 
I only live for you love and you kiss 
it be paradise to be near you like this 
because of you my life be now worthwhile 
and I can smile because of you
