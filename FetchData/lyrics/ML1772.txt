[Verse 1]
It was long after midnight
When we got to unconditional love
She said, 'Sure, my heart is boundless
But don't push my limits too far'
I said, 'If love was so transcendent
I don't understand these boundaries'
She said, 'Just don't disappoint me
You know how complex women are'
[Chorus 1]
I'll be around
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down
[Verse 2]
It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said, 'Sure, I'll be your partner
But don't make too many demands'
I said, 'If love has these conditions
I don't understand those songs you love'
She said, 'This is not a love song
This isn't fantasyland
[Bridge]
(Don't go too far)
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
(Don't cross the line)
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
(Don't let me down)
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
(Don't break the spell)
The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire
[Chorus 2]
I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down
I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down
[Solo]
[Bridge]
(Don't go too far)
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
(Don't cross the line)
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
(Don't let me down)
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
(Don't break the spell)
The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire
[Chorus 3]
I'll be around
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down
I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down
I'll be around
If you don't let me down
[Outro]
Love is blind if you are gentle
Love can turn to a long, cold burn...
