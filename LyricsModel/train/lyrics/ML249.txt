[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Dancin' in the dark, middle of the night
Takin' your heart and holdin' it tight
Emotional touch touchin' my skin
And askin' you to do what you've been doin' all over again
[Pre-Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go
[Chorus: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
It's your love
It just does something to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love
[Verse 2: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
Better than I was, more than I am
And all of this happened by takin' your hand
And who I am now is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together, I'm stronger than ever
I'm happy and free
[Pre-Chorus: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in, no
And if you asked me why I changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name
[Chorus: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love
Oh, baby
[Pre-Chorus: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go
[Chorus: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
It's your love
It just does something' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love
[Outro: Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill]
It's your love
It's your love
