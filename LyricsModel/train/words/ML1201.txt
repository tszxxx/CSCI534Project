never know how much I love you 
never know how much I care 
when you put you arm around I 
I get a fever that be so hard to bear 
you give I fever when you kiss I 
fever when you hold I tight 
fever in the mornin 
fever all through the night 
Sun light up the day time 
moon light up the night 
I light up when you call my name 
cause I know you be go to treat I right 
you give I fever when you kiss I 
fever when you hold I tight 
fever in the mornin 
fever all through the night 
everybody be get the fever 
that be something you all know 
fever be not such a new thing 
Fever start long time ago 
baby turn on you love light 
let it shine on I 
well baby turn on you love light 
and let it shine on I 
well just a little bit higher 
and just a little bit brighter baby 
you give I fever
