when I feel 
you dream 
I think of sunset 
how high my high get 
I want to give you a everlasting love 
I want to fill you life with a satisfying love 
all you need be a everlast love 
all you want be a satisfying love 
summer breeze 
Moonlight tease 
friendly invasion 
late night persuasion 
I want to give you a everlasting love 
wanna fill you life with a satisfying love 
all you need be a everlast love 
all you want be a mystifying love 
each 
time you 
pass 
I by 
you slowly fade away 
I need you more each day 
I want to give you a everlasting love 
wanna fill you life with a satisfying love 
all you need be a everlast love 
all you want be a mystifying love
