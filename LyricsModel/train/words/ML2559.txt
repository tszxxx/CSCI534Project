shall I stay or go 
through the door 
will the pen to flow 
watch the star 
sleep be a chore 
the moon be grow cold 
it hang like a sliver of tin 
how do we dream unfold 
and why be my bone feel thin 
I watch my pen as though 
my finger could shatter like icicle 
and before my eye 
lie glitter and useless on a field of snow
