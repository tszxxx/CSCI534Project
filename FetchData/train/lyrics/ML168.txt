[Verse 1]
If I gave you pretty enough words
Could you paint a picture of us that works?
An emphasis on function rather than design
Aren't you tired? Cause I will carry you on a broken back
And blown out knees
I have been where you are for a while
[Chorus]
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night, every evening that I die
[Bridge]
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human
[Verse 2]
After all these images of pain have cut right through you
I will kiss every scar, and weep you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place in my chest where my heart still tries to beat, it sets us apart
[Chorus]
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night, every evening that I die
[Outro]
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
