he will start drinkin and he will start thinkin about she 
again again and again 
he musta bring the jukebox cause those old sad song they just will not 
end they just will not end 
he old broken heart it still burn with desire 
cause you can not put out a old flame 
by pour whiskey on the fire 
chorus 
and tonight he will make a toast to she memory 
and then he will take another shot of a 100 proof of misery 
and he old broken heart still burn with desire 
cause you can not put out a old flame 
by pour whiskey on the fire 
he tear fall like rain but he pain just will not die down 
cause there be another blaze that be brewin 
as he busy another round 
repeat chorus 
he will start drinkin and he will start thinkin about she 
again
