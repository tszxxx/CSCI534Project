cloud part 
just to give we a little sun 
there be a limit to you love 
like a waterfall in slow motion 
like a map with no ocean 
there be a limit to you love 
you love you love you love 
there be a limit to you care 
so carelessly there 
be it truth or dare 
there be a limit to you care 
I love I love I love 
this dream of go upstream 
I love I love I love 
the trouble that you give I 
I know I know I know 
that only I can save I 
I will go I will go I will go 
right down the road 
there be a limit to you love 
like a waterfall in slow motion 
like a map with no ocean 
there be a limit to you love 
you love you love you love 
I can not read you smile 
it should be write on you face 
I be piece it together 
there be something out of place 
oh 
I love I love I love 
this dream of go upstream 
I love I love I love 
the trouble that you give I 
I know I know I know 
that only I can save I 
I will go I will go I will go 
out on the road 
because there be no limit 
there be no limit 
no limit no limit no limit 
limit to my love
