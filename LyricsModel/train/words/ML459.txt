like a comet 
blaze across the evening sky 
go too soon 
like a rainbow 
fade in the twinkling of a eye 
go too soon 
shiny and sparkly 
and splendidly bright 
here one day 
go one night 
like the loss of sunlight 
on a cloudy afternoon 
go too soon 
like a castle 
build upon a sandy beach 
go too soon 
like a perfect flower 
that be just beyond you reach 
go too soon 
bear to amuse 
to inspire to delight 
here one day 
go one night 
like a sunset 
die with the rise of the moon 
go too soon 
go too soon
