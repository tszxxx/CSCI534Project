Some couples go for a buggy ride
When they start caring a lot
Others will bicycle side by side
Out to some romantic spot
But when you haven't a sou
There's only one thing to do
Let's take an old-fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told
If we went for an old-fashioned walk
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled may relax
On an old-fashioned walk
I know for a couple who seem
To be miles apart
There's nothing like walking
And having a heart to heart
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold
Coming home from an old-fashioned walk
I used to dream of a millionaire
Handsome and rich from the States
Taking me out for a breath of air
Saying, "The carriage awaits"
But since you haven't a sou
And I have nothing to do
Let's take an old-fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told
If we went for an old-fashioned walk
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled may relax
On an old-fashioned walk
I know for a couple who seem
To be miles apart
There's nothing like walking
And having a heart to heart
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold
Coming home from an old-fashioned walk
