so clever whatever I be do with these endeavor 
alone I walk the wind way 
it be over no longer I feel it grow stronger 
I live to die another day 
until I fade away 
why give up why give in 
it be not enough it never be 
so I will go on until the end 
we have become desolate 
it be not enough it never be 
but I will go on until the end 
surround I it be easy to fall apart completely 
I feel you creep up again 
it be over no longer I feel it grow colder 
I know this day would come to end 
so let this life begin 
why give up why give in 
it be not enough it never be 
so I will go on until the end 
we have become desolate 
it be not enough it never be 
but I will go on until the end 
I have lose my way I have lose my way 
but I will go on until the end 
live be hard enough without you fuck up 
why give up why give in 
it be not enough it never be 
so I will go on until the end 
we have become desolate 
it be not enough it never be 
but I will go on until the end 
I have lose my way I have lose my way 
but I will go on until the end 
the final fight I win 
the final fight I win 
the final fight I win 
but I will go on until the end
