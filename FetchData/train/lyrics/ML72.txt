[Verse 1]
I bet you're kicking yourself for letting me walk away
Making yourself a list of the things you wish you didn't say
Sitting by the phone hoping it's gonna ring
[Chorus]
Tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely
[Verse 2]
Sometimes you're up all night crying over me
You've gotta take off of work to catch up on your sleep
But that just don't work, now does it, baby
[Chorus]
So tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely
[Bridge]
Tell me you get lonely, and I'll come back
All you've gotta do is call me, my bag's been packed
I'm dying of pride, but I want you to know
[Chorus]
That I get lonely when it's cold outside
Baby, I'm only barely getting by
And it still hurts every time that I hear your name
It ain't the same without you, girl
Baby, I get lonely
Yeah, I get lonely
Tell me you get lonely, too
Tell me you get lonely
