I have see you face on stain glass in color light 
in picture of you look to the sky 
you have be portray a thousand different way 
but my heart can see you better than my eye 
cause it be love that paint the portrait of you life 
the face of love 
the face of love 
you look more like love every day 
I have read you word in the page of you life 
and I have imagine what you be like 
I may not know the shape of you face 
but I can feel you heart change mine 
and you love still prove you be alive 
the face of love 
the face of love 
you look more like love every day 
you be the face that change the whole world 
no one too lose for you to love 
no one too low for you to serve 
so give we the grace to change the world 
no one too lose for I to love 
no one too low for I to serve 
let we see 
let we be you face 
the face of love 
the face of love 
you look more like love every day
