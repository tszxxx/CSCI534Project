(Mother in law)
Mother in law
(Mother in law)
Mother in law
The worst person I know
(Mother in law, mother in law)
(Mother in law, mother in law)
A she worries me, so
If she'd leave us alone
A we would have a happy home
Sent from down below
Mother in law, mother in law
Satan should be her name
To me they're bout the same
Every time I open my mouth
She steps in, tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low
I come home with my pay
She asks me what I made
She thinks her advice is the constitution
But if she would leave that would be the solution
And don't come back no more
Mother in law
My mother in law, ah
Oh, yeah
