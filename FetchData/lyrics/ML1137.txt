[Verse 1]
Best intentions bring joyless droughts
Pack your hacksaw come bust me out
When your dentures prevent your smile
These adventures will fill your eyes
[Hook]
With love
With love
[Verse 2]
You've been going see-through, could do with a little sun
I'd give my liver to see you abide and ride shotgun
A bacchian scandal awaits me, just can't do it alone
Your sweetheart probably hates me
, but I'll send you home
Your dome filled up with love
[Hook]
With love
With love
Fill your eyes with love
[Hook]
With love
With love
[Bridge]
Love will find you out
Be sure love will find you out
Love will find you out
Be sure love will find you out
As anybody with a kind word would know
Gonna find you
Love will find you out
Be sure love will find you out
As anybody with a kind word would know
Gonna find you
Love will find you out
Be sure love will find you out
Fill your boots
Fill your spine
Fill your dome
Fill your eyes with love
[Bridge]
With love
With love
With love
With love
With love
With love
With love
With love
