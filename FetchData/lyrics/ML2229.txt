Young girl by your side
She asks no questions
So you don't lie
How effortless it can be
She feels lucky
And you are free
I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you that way
I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you still
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved you that way
You that way, you that way
And now it's been two years
Do they know you still come here?
And day gives in to night
And then guilty morning light
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved me that way
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved me still
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved me that way
Me that way, me that way
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved you that way
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved you still
Shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved you that way
You that way, you that way
You that way
