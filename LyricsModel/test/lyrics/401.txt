Appreciate
The fact you're
Sitting here
Your voice sounds
So wonderful
But your face don't
Look too clear
So barmaid bring a pitcher
Another round of brew
Honey why don't we get drunk and screw
Why don't we get drunk and screw
I just bought
A waterbed
It's filled up for me and you
They said you are a Snow Queen
Honey I don't think that's true
So why don't we get drunk and screw
Pick it Coral Reefers, here we go
(Solo music break)
Why don't we get drunk and screw
I just bought a waterbed
It's filled up for me and you
They said you are a Snow Queen
Honey I don't think that's true
So why don't we get drunk and screw
Yah now baby
Why dont we get drunk and screw
