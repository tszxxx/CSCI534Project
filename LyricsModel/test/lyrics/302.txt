[Verse 1]
Realize that I can never win
Sometimes feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin?
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we supposed to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me
[Chorus]
I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I can never tell
If I've got something after me
That's why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we suppose to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me
[Chorus]
I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me
[Bridge]
Betrayed, I feel so insane
I really tried, I did my time
I did my time
I did my time!
I did my time!
I did my time!
[Chorus]
I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me
[Outro]
Oh God, the anger's changing me!
Oh God, the anger's changing me!
