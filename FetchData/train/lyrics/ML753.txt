[Verse 1]
She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
But an eighteen year old boy has got to eat
[Verse 2]
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose
[Chorus]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand
[Verse 3]
She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do
[Verse 4]
And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
She died knowing someone really loved her
Of life's bramble bush I picked a rose
[Chorus x2]
