something in I dark and sticky 
all the time it be get strong 
no way of deal with this feeling 
can not go on like this too long 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
I tell you I tell you I tell you I tell you 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
I tell you I tell you I tell you I tell you 
do not talk back 
just drive the car 
shut you mouth 
I know what you be 
do not say nothing 
keep you hand on the wheel 
do not turn around 
this be for real 
dig in the dirt 
stay with I I need support 
I be dig in the dirt 
to find the place I get hurt 
open up the place I get hurt 
the more I look the more I find 
as I close on in I get so blind 
I feel it in my head I feel it in my toe 
I feel it in my sex that be the place it go 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
I tell you I tell you I tell you I tell you 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
this time you have go too far 
I tell you I tell you I tell you I tell you 
do not talk back 
just drive the car 
shut you mouth 
I know what you be 
do not say nothing 
keep you hand on the wheel 
do not turn around 
this be for real 
dig in the dirt 
stay with I I need support 
I be dig in the dirt 
to find the place I get hurt 
open up the place I get hurt 
I be dig in the dirt 
stay with I I need support 
I be dig in the dirt 
to find the place I get hurt 
open up the place I get hurt 
dig in the dirt 
to find the place we get hurt
