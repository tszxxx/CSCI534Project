in a fever dream dark night of the soul 
well twas brillig and the slithey tove 
I bid the world good bye by the dead bog oak 
Drop down in the Swampblood 
I be wash in the Swampblood 
I be wash in the blood 
dusty bible lead to a dirty south 
he be sittin with a toadstool rot in he mouth 
in a clear where the bras hang down from the tree 
he be cappin a coffee can full of tooth 
down Doom 's Chapel Raod past he great grandma 
she say turn 'e loose or I will call the law 
he say there be no testimony without the test 
what we do with we own be we own damn business 
Drop down in the Swampblood 
I be wash in the Swampblood 
I be wash in the blood
