[Verse 1]
When I saw you at the discotheque
Sent my vibe out to you
Then we met up on the dance floor where
You said "I'm gonna teach you"
(Gonna teach you, teach you)
[Chorus]
Oh baby you got me going
So insane and I just don't know what's going down
And I try to get off my knees and
Try to f-f-fight this feeling, but I can't
Oh baby you got me going
So insane and I just don't know what's going down
And I try to get off my knees and
Try to f-f-fight this feeling, but I can't
[Verse 2]
Now that you're here I know just what to do
Now that you're here I'm gonna come, come to you
Now that you're, now that you're, now, now, now, now
I know just what to do
Now that you're here I'm gonna come, come to you
[Chorus]
Oh baby you got me going
So insane and I just don't know what's going down
And I try to get off my knees and
Try to f-f-fight this feeling, but I can't
Oh baby you got me going
So insane and I just don't know what's going down
And I try to get off my knees and
Try to f-f-fight this feeling
But I can't
[Outro]
I don't even know what to do, do that
I can't help this feeling
Baby you got me going
I don't even know what to do
And I don't, and I do, even know, I can't help this feeling
And I don't even know what to do
I don't even know what to do
Oh, I don't even know what to do
