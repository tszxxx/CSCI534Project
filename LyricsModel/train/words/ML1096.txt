distant star 
come in black or red 
I have see they world 
inside my head 
they connect 
with the fall of man 
they breathe you in 
then dive as deep as they can and 
there be nothing you can do for they 
they be the force between 
when the sunlight be arise 
there be nothing you can say to he 
he be in outer heart 
and the space have be break 
it be broken 
we love 
broken 
it be broken 
we love 
broken 
be it far away 
in the glitter freeze 
or in we eye 
every time they meet 
it be by the light 
of the plasma screen 
we keep switch on 
all through the night while we sleep 
there be nothing you can do for they 
they be the force between 
when the sunlight be arise 
there be nothing you can say to she 
I be without a heart 
and the space have be break 
it be broken 
we love 
broken 
it be broken 
we love 
broken 
it be broken 
we love 
broken 
it be broken 
we love 
broken
