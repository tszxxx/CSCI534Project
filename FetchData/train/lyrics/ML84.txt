[Intro]
[Verse 1]
So you think your schooling's phony
I guess it's hard not to agree
You say it all depends on money
And who is in your family tree
[Hook]
Right, (Right), you're bloody well right
You got a bloody right to say
Right, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say
Ha-ha you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Yeah, yeah, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Me, I don't care anyway
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
Write your problems down in detail
Take them to a higher place
You've had your cry, no, I shouldn't say wail
In the meantime hush your face
[Hook]
Right, (Quite right), you're bloody well right
You got a bloody right to say
Right, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say
Ha ha, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Yeah, yeah, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
[Outro]
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
