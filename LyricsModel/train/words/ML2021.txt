beneath the winter snow 
or so I have be tell 
they say be bury far 
just like a distant star 
I simply can not hold

December never feel so wrong 
cause you be not where you belong

and send it out tonight 
so we can start again

December never feel so wrong 
because you be not where you belong 
inside my arm
