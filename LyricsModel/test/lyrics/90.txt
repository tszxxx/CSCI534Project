[Instrumental Intro]
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
I'm running in quicksand
Something's haunting me
The guilty past I've buried
My mind won't let me sleep
I'll do anything for peace (I keep waking up)
A solemn oath I make
Cross my heart, please let me sleep (I keep waking up)
How much more do I take?
My head is talking to me
I don't know what it needs
But the loudest voice
Is the one I heed
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
My swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
Awake 'til morning light
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
Stirring deep inside
Insomni-omni-omni-omnia
Somebody turn out the lights
I, I, I can't sleep
I, I - insomnia
I'm twisting and turning (I keep waking up)
The madness I must tame
My candle is burning (I keep waking up)
Both ends again today
The whole house is creaking
I know they're out there
The things kept from sight
I beg to the shadows, I can't sleep
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
Footsteps on the walk
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
I hear someone knock
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
I wish it was a dream
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
Can you hear me scream?
[Instrumental Break]
I can't sleep!
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
My swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
Awake 'til morning light
Insomni-omni-omni-omni-omnia
Stirring deep inside
Insomni-omni-omni-omnia
Somebody turn out the lights
Insomnia, insomnia
Insomnia, insomnia
I, I, I, - insomnia
I can't sleep
Insomnia
I, I can't sleep
I, I can't sleep
Insomnia
I, I can't sleep
Insomnia
I can't sleep
I can't sleep
I can't sleep
