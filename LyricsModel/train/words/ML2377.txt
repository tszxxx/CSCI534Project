he want some angry young I and 
one who can not be buy 
one who will not run from a fight 
one who speak the truth whether it be popular or not 
one who will give up anything to walk in he light 
Rest assure when Jesus come again 
he will be look for some angry young I and 
he want some angry young man with fire in they eye 
one who understand what Jesus give 
one who have grow weary of the world and all it 's life 
one who will not forget they have be deliver from the grave 
Rest assure when Jesus come again 
he will come back for the angry young I and 
yes he will 
they say if you do not you cry 
I say if you do not live you will die 
well the road to hell be pave with some impressive alibis 
but unless you thirst for Jesus first 
man heaven will pass you by 
you will be tempt try and test 
there will be war the devil win 
but God 's love be not a license 
to lie there in you sin 
he understand the human heart

but he grace be not intend 
as a place to wipe you foot 
Rest assure when Jesus come again 
he will be look for some angry young I and 
who love the Lord they serve 
one who will do much more than make a speech 
one who act they faith out with the passion it deserve 
cause if we can not live it tell I who be we to preach 
Rest assure when Jesus come again 
he will come back for the angry young I and 
Rest assure when Jesus come again 
he will be look for the angry young I and 
he will be look yes he will
