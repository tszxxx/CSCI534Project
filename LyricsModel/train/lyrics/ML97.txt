[Verse 1]
Well I've heard lots of people say
They're going to settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
[Chorus]
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right
[Verse 2]
Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home
[Chorus]
You got that right
Said you got that right
Well, you got that right
Sure got that right
[Bridge]
I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Travelling around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travelling jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
[Chorus]
