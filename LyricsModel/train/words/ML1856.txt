it be a Monday when my lover tell I 
never pay the reaper with love only 
what could I say to you except I love you 
and I would give my life for yours 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one dear 
the first time we make love I I be not sober 
and you tell I you love I over and over 
how can I ever love another when I miss you everyday 
remember the time we make love in the rose 
and you take my picture in all sort of pose 
how can I ever get over you when I would give my life for yours 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one dear 
my dear 
it be time to say thank God for you 
I thank God for you in each and every single way 
I know I know I know I know 
it be time to let you know 
time to let you know 
time to let you know 
time to sit here and say 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one 
I know we be we be the lucky one dear dear 
we be the lucky one dear dear 
we be the lucky one dear dear 
we be the lucky one dear 
we be the lucky one dear 
we be the lucky one dear
