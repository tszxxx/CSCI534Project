it do not come easy 
you know it do not come easy 
it do not come easy 
you know it do not come easy 
get to pay you due if you want to sing the blue 
and you know it do not come easy 
you do not have to shout or leap about 
you can even play they easy 
forget about the past and all you sorrow 
the future will not last 
it will soon be over tomorrow 
I do not ask for much I only want trust 
and you know it do not come easy 
and this love of mine keep grow all the time 
and you know it just be not easy 
open up you heart let 's come together 
use a little love 
and we will make it work out better 
get to pay you due if you want to sing the blue 
and you know it do not come easy 
you do not have to shout or leap about 
you can even play they easy 
peace remember peace be how we make it 
here within you reach 
if you be big enough to take it 
I do not ask for much I only want trust 
and you know it do not come easy 
and this love of mine keep grow all the time 
and you know it do not come easy
