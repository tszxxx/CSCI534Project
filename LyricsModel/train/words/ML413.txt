hey how have you be good to see you again 
gee it be be a long time 
how be that new man Mom and dad 
since I tell you goodbye 
now I be still the same still raisin Cain 
nobody be worried bout I 
I come and&amp I go just as I please 
since I set myself free 
but I can not win for losin you 
I just can not get over you 
bein footloose and fancy free 
be not all it be crack up to be 
and the grass be not no greener 
here on the other side 
I might win a heart or two 
but I can not win for losin you 
well I be on my way there be so much to say 
Lord know that I have have my time 
girl you can bet I will never forget 
when you use to be mine 
but I can not win for losin you 
I just can not get over you 
bein footloose and fancy free 
be not all it be crack up to be 
and the grass be not no greener 
here on the other side 
I might win a heart or two 
but I can not win for losin you
