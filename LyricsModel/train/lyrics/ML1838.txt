[Verse 1]
She said she'd take me any way, she'd take me every way
As long as she stays with me
She said she'd take me every way, she'd take me any way
As long as I'm good and clean
[Hook]
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
[Verse 2]
She said she'd take me every time, she'd take me anytime
As long as she stays with me
She said she'd take me everyday, she'd take me any way
And it would be free
[Hook]
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
[Verse 3]
She said she'd take me any way, she'd take me every way
As long as she stays with me
She said she'd take me everywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as I'm good and clean
[Hook]
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
