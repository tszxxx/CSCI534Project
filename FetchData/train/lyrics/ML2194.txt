[Chorus]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Around your virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace[x2]
[Verse]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds, quake at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born[x2]
[Chorus]
