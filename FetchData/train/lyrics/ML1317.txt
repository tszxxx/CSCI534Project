Every now and then when the world steps in
Stealin' all our time away
It soon takes so much, we forget to touch
That's when I know it's time for me to say
Take my hand let's walk through love's door
And be free from the world once more
Here's my arms, we can hide today
And love the world away
Once again we'll be where our hearts are free
And the time is ours to share
Love will always stay just a touch away
Come with me all the magic's waiting there
Take my hand let's walk through love's door
And be free from the world once more
Here's my heart, we can hide today
And love the world away
We can love the world away...
