well ya can not sit still 
file Gliss Morning light 
nobody ask you to 
when you close you eye 
darling do it look so fine 
in the morning light 
can not even see you face 
in the morning light 
I can not even see you face 
in you heart 
in you heart

in you heart

in you heart 
Darlin it be a start 
Darlin in you heart

nobody could sympathize 
only in my dream 
everything come to life

in you heart 
it be a start 
in you heart 
in you heart 
in you heart 
Darlin it be a start 
Darlin in you heart

in you heart 
Darlin it be a start 
Darlin in you heart
