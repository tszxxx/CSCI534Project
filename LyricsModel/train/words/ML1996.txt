if I be to say to you can you keep a secret 
would you know just what to do or where to keep it 
then I say I love you foul the situation 
hey girl I think we be the right combination 
who break my heart you do you do 
bow to the target blame Cupid Cupid 
you think you be smart stupid stupid 
shoot that poison arrow to my heart 
shoot that poison arrow 
shoot that poison arrow to my heart 
shoot that poison arrow 
no rhythm in cymbal no tempo in drum 
love on arrival she come when she come 
right on the target but wide of the mark 
what I think be fire be only the spark 
the sweetest melody be a unheard refrain 
so lower you sight yeah 
but raise you aim raise you aim 
I think you love I but it seem you do not care 
I care enough to know I can never love you 
who break my heart you do you do 
bow to the target blame Cupid 
you think you be smart that be stupid 
right from the start when you know we would part 
shoot that poison arrow to my heart 
shoot that poison arrow 
shoot that poison arrow to my heart heart heart 
shoot that poison arrow 
heart shoot that poison arrow 
shoot that poison arrow
