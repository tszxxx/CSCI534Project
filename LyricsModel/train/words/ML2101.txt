mornin rain keep on fallin 
like the tear that fall from my eye 
oh as I sit as I sit in my room stare out at the gloom 
it be the rain it be the same old blue 
I can not help I can not help but think 
when the sun use to shine shine in my back door 
yes now the sun have turn to rain 
and all my laughter have turn to pain 
it be the pain of the same old blue 
Sunshine sunshine be all you see now 
but it all look like it all look like cloud to I 
but as I sit as I sit in my room 
just stare out the window look at the gloom 
oh it be the rain and it be the same same old blue 
it be the rain and it ?s the same old blue 
yes yes it s the rain and it ?s the same the same old blue yeah
