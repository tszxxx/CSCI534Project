she daddy tell she all the fact 
he mama teach he how to act 
at puberty they pay they due 
the pool hall be the Moulin Rouge 
and he like she skirt 
and she like he tight levi 's 
Fannin 's flame of the fire 
that burn higher than the fire in they eye 
mama 's downtown on she lip 
Daddy be on a business trip 
a pinch from Mama 's treasure chest 
Daddy come up with the rest 
and some people 's kid do not know how fast time fly 
now they be payin for the fire burnin higher than the fire in they eye 
some people 's kid can not see 
all some people 's kid really need 
be someone to be there 
to love them and to care about they 
Daddy be a rollin stone 
mama choose to live alone 
Susie be out there on the wine 
Jimmy be friend of mine 
and some people 's kid get to sing so it be no surprise 
that the flame of the fire 's burnin higher than the fire in they eye
