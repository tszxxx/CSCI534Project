[Verse 1]
Here's a copy of the lesson you know
And put the kind words to bed
For man don't say why or even know how
It's only awful as the hell that you know
[Chorus]
When islands want to coast
Islands want to coast
They'll know how
Yeah, they'll know how
[Verse 2]
And only hours before the house had burned down
He shut the other door
But if I don't see now or even know why
It's only awful as the hell that you know
[Chorus]
When islands want to coast
Islands want to coast
They'll know how
Yeah, they'll know how
[Bridge]
Home, home, home
Home, home, home
Home, home, home
Home, home
[Verse 3]
He was writing in the lesson you know
Let's take the other door
Now if I don't think right or even know how
It's only awful as the hell that you know
[Chorus]
When islands want to coast
Islands want to coast
They'll know how
Yeah, they'll know how
[Bridge]
Home, home, home
Home, home, home
Home, home
Home, home
