every time I think about where we be and where we be 
something that be unbelievable 
we be build on the slow but to see it come together 
it be like a dream 's achievable 
we have bump along the way quite a few surprise 
but we hold fast deal with all the compromise 
put we pride aside how we sacrifice so long 
for something we could call we own 
every single brick and every single nail 
every single triumph and every single fail 
cause the house of love that we live in 
I know it be from the ground cause we build it 
this house this house this house 
we build a house of love 
this house this house this house 
we build a house of love 
I use to think of all the thing we have overcome 
as just we history 
but now I know that all the thing we build together 
will be we legacy 
the world will know that we be here 
we intent to stay sincere we purpose and heart be clear 
we baby will have baby of they own 
and we love will live on for generation to come 
every single brick and every single nail 
every single triumph and every single fail 
cause the house of love that we live in 
I know it be from the ground cause we build it 
every single brick and every single nail 
every single triumph and every single fail 
cause the house of love that we live in 
I know it be from the ground cause we build it 
this house this house this house 
we build a house of love 
this house this house this house 
we build a house of love 
every step solid rock as a foundation 
and a roof make of hope for we protection 
a room of opportunity drive by affection 
and every room I put my heart 
and if these wall they could talk
