hello wall how would thing go for you today 
do not you miss she since she upp and walk away 
and I will bet you dread to spend another lonely night with I 
but lonely wall I will keep you company 
hello window well I see that you be still here 
be not you lonely since we darling disappear 
well look here be that a teardrop in the corner of you pane 
now do not you try to tell I that it be rain 
she go away and leave we all alone the way she plan 
yes we will have to learn to get along without she if we can and 
hello ceiling I be go to stare at you awhile 
you know I can not sleep so will not you bear with I awhile 
we must all stick together or else I will lose my mind 
I have get a feeling she will be go a long long time
