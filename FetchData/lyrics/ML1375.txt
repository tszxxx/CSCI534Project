[Verse 1]
Until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and permanently
Discredited and abandoned
Everywhere is war
[Verse 2]
Until there is no longer first class
Or second class citizens of any nation
That until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
I've got to say "war"
[Verse 3]
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Then we say "war"
[Verse 4]
That until that day the dream of lasting peace
World-citizenship and the rule of
International morality will remain
Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never obtained
And everywhere is war
[Verse 5]
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
There'll be war
And the rumors of war
[Verse 6]
That until the ignoble and unhappy regime
Which holds our sisters in Africa, yeah
Africa, yeah
Sub-human bondage has been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Everywhere is war
[Verse 7]
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight - we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
'Cause we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil
Good over evil
Good over evil
