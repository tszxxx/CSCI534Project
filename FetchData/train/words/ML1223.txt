you weave you spell you eye they beckon I you lip they speak , lie and misery I know it 's wrong , but I can not turn away the flame draw near , they be tell I to stay I be fall I be fall into the fire into the fire into the fire I be fall into the fire you love burn bright , and yet the flame be cold this time I fear , you will not be back no more when will it end , you love consume my soul into the fire , I be be tempte once more I be fall I be fall into the fire into the fire into the fire I be fall int - take I back where I come from do not want to see you face no more you break my heart , now it 's not the same I be fall , again I be fall , again into the fire into the fire into the fire into the fire I be fall again into the fire into the fire I be fall again into the fire I be fall into the fire into the fire into the fire I be fall into the fire
