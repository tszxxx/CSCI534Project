have yourself a Merry Little Christmas 
let you heart be light 
from now on we trouble will be out of sight 
have yourself a Merry Little Christmas 
make the Yuletide Gay 
from now on we trouble will be far away 
and here we be as in Olden Days 
happy golden day of yore 
faithful Friends who be dear to we 
gather near to we 
once more 
through the year we all will be together 
if the Fates allow 
hang a Shining Star upon the Highest Bough 
and have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now 
and have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now
