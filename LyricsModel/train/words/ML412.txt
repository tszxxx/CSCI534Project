she arrive in all she splendor 
each night at nine o'clock 
she chariot be the crosstown bus 
that stop right down the block 
now the old piano minstrel play she tune as she walk in 
and the Queen of the Silver dollar 's home again 
she be the Queen of the Silver dollar 
she rule this smokey kingdom 
scepter be a wine glass and a bar stool be she throne 
now the jester flock around she try to win she favor 
to see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver dollar home 
now she royal dress be satin 
it be shabby and it be tear 
the royal jewel be rhinestone 
the shoe be scuff and wear 
of the many road she be be down 
and the place that she be see 
well they all look at she and say God save the queen 
now the Queen of the Silver dollar 
be not as haughty as she seem 
she be once a ordinary girl with ordinary dream 
but there be a man who find she 
and he bring she to this world 
he be the one who make a queen of a simple country girl
