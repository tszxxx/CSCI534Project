[Verse 1]
Until the day you die
You always admit
You were right
You were right
About all of it
[Chorus]
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
[Verse 2]
Until the day I die
Columbia I blame
Brought us back
Back to life
Drifted off again
[Chorus]
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gets his ass whipped
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gets his ass whipped
