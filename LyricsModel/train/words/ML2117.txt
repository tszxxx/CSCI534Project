it may not kill I but it be sure go to hurt 
since my baby leave I I do not know what to do 
just could not believe my eye when I see he with you 
he leave I for you oh he be treat I like dirt 
it may not kill I but it be sure go to hurt 
it be sure go to hurt to lose you 
my poor heart 's in pain 
do not see how you could abuse I 
it be drive I insane 
oh you be both out paintin the town red 
well I be paintin it too but I be not paintin the town red 
I be paintin it blue 
it hurt to lose everything to such a little flirt 
it may not kill I but it be sure go to hurt 
it be sure go to hurt to lose you 
my poor heart 's in pain 
do not see how you could abuse I 
it be drive I insane 
oh you be both out paintin the town red 
well I be paintin it too but I be not paintin the town red 
I be paintin it blue 
it hurt to lose everything to such a little flirt 
it may not kill I but it be sure go to hurt 
it be sure go to hurt 
it be sure go to hurt to lose you 
my poor heart 's in pain 
do not see how you could abuse I 
it be drive I insane
