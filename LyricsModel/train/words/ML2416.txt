the atom will implode 
the fragile kingdom fall 
the tremor become a quake 
and there be a body in the lake 
and as the two of we rebel 
damn you all to hell 
I wonder be this all there be 
time will help you through 
but it do not have the time 
to give you all the answer 
to the never end why 
the sound of silence grow 
as the spider 's kiss be lay 
the tumor become malign 
but the kid be do fine 
and as the two of we rebel 
and damn you all to hell 
I wonder be this all there be
