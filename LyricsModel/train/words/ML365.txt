love be a burn thing 
and it make a fiery ring 
bound by wild desire 
I fall in to a ring of fire 
I fall into a burn ring of fire 
I go down down dow and 
and the flame go higher 
and it burn burn burn 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
I fall into a burn ring of fire 
I go down down dow and 
and the flame go higher 
and it burn burn burn 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
the taste of love be sweet 
when heart like ours meet 
I fall for you like a child 
oh but the fire go wild 
I fall in to a burn ring of fire 
I go down down dow and 
and the flame go higher 
and it burn burn burn 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
I fall into a burn ring of fire 
I go down down dow and 
and the flame go higher 
and it burn burn burn 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
and it burn burn burn 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
the ring
