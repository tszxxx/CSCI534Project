another 
summer 
day 
have come and go away 
in Paris and Rome 
but I want to go home mmm 
may be surround by 
a million people I 
still feel all alone 
I just want to go home 
oh I miss you you know 
and I have be keep all the letter 
that I write to you 
each one a line or two 
I be fine baby how be you 
well I would send they but I know 
that it be just not enough 
my word be cold and flat 
and you deserve more than that 
another aeroplane 
another sunny place 
I be lucky I know 
but I want to go home 
mmm I get to go home 
let I go home 
I be just too far 
from where you be 
I want to come home 
and I feel just like 
I be live someone else 's life 
it be like I just step outside 
when everything be go right 
and I know just why you could not 
come along with I 
that this be not you dream 
but you always believe in I 
another 
winter day 
have come and go away 
in even Paris and Rome 
and I want to go home 
let I go home 
and I be surround by 
a million people I 
I still feel alone 
oh let I go home 
oh I miss you you know 
let I go home 
I have have my run 
baby I be 
do 
I get to go home 
let I go home 
it will all be all right 
I will be home tonight 
I be come back home
