[Verse 1]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
[Chorus]
It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Mmm
Oh
Help me, somebody
Mmm
[Verse 2]
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
[Chorus]
It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Oh, yeah
[Outro]
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keep me searching and I'm growing old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keep me searching and I'm growing old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Woo
