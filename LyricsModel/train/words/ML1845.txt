send I the pillow that you dream on 
do not you know that I still care for you 
send I the pillow that you dream on 
so darl I can dream on it too 
each night while I be sleep oh so lonely 
I will share you loving dream that once be true 
send I the pillow that you dream on 
so darl I can dream on it too 
but just a memory 's all that be leave of I 
so send I the pillow that you dream on 
so darl I can dream on it too 
so darl I can dream on it too
