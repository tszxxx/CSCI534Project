I leave while you be sleep 
while Abraham shape you sigh 
never love you less never love you more 
as when Sirius hang in the sky 
a memory be a memory 
and a dream be a liar 
be I a man dream I be a lamb 
or be I sleep in clover tonight 
while man be dream 
they know it not a dream 
upon waking we be fool again 
what if we be sleep 
a memory be a memory 
and a dream be a liar 
be I a woman to never see you again 
or be I dream asleep by you side
