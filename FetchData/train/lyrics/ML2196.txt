[Verse 1]
My baby she told me
She don't want to hold me (oh, no!)
And kiss my lips anymore (unh-unh!)
She's going to leave me
And she don't believe me
That I'll be true now
Well maybe she don't love me
And is not thinking of me
But why'd she do it this time of year?
She knows that I'll miss her
And I'll want to kiss her
If just for Christmas
[Chorus 1]
Merry Christmas, baby[x3]
[Verse 2]
Tell me, what did I do
To really convince you
That I'm not the guy anymore?
Take back my ring now
I'll do anything now
But please forgive me
[Chorus 2]
I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh why did we break up?
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas
[Chorus 1]
Merry Christmas, baby[x3]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Outro]
Merry Christmas, baby
