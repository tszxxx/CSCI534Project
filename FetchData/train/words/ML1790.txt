I leave while you be sleeping while Abraham shape you sigh never love you less , never love you more as when Sirius hang in the sky a memory be a memory and a dream be a liar be I a man dream I be a lamb ? or be I sleeping in clover tonight ? while man be dream they know it not a dream upon wake , we be fool again what if we be sleeping ? a memory be a memory and a dream be a liar be I a woman to never see you again ? or be I dream asleep by you side ?
