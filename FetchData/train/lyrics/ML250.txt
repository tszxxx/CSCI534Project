[Verse 1: Chris Cornell]
I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
, yeah
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies,
 
while the slaves are all workin'
Blood is on the table and the mouths are all chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry, yeah
[Verse 2: Eddie Vedder]
I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
, uh huh
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies, while the slaves are all workin'
And it's on the table,
 
their mouths are all chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
[Refrain: Vedder &amp; (Cornell)]
I'm goin' hungry (I'm goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
[Interlude]
[Refrain: Vedder &amp; (Cornell)]
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
[Outro: Vedder &amp; (Cornell)]
(Yeah, I don't mind stealin' bread) I don't mind
(No, I don't mind stealin' bread)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
