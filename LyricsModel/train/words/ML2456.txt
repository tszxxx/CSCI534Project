you eye be on my wall you tooth be over there 
but I be still no one and you be now a star 
what do you care 
be think about you and there be no rest 
shit I still love you still see you in bed 
but I be play with myself and what do you care 
when the other man be far far better 
all the thing you have get 
all the thing you need 
who buy you cigarette 
who bribe the company to come and see you honey 
I have be think about you so how can you sleep 
these people be not you friend they be pay to kiss you foot 
they do not know what I know and why should you care 
when I be not there 
be think about you and there be no rest 
should I still love you still see you in bed 
but I be play with myself and what do you care 
when I be not there 
all the thing you have get 
she will never need 
all the thing you have get 
I have bled and I bleed to please you 
be think about you
