Home for Christmas leave be fallin ' December be callin ' Feels like that time of the year ooh and a chill in my bone get I think of home and everyone I hold dear if ever I miss my connection strand and feeling alone but no matter how mean this hard road treat I I always could find my way home Dont you know that you be in my heart and I always come home for Christmas we be live apart we be so close we be so far I will still come home for Christmas it might be just for a day but I will still come home for Christmas oh how I wish I could stay but the year slip away I come home for Christmas and I will always come home I see all the light someone tell I tonight put the star on the tree it 's a feeling I know I will never let go like my first holiday memory sometimes we all miss we connection we be strand and feeling alone but no matter how mean this hard road seem to be we always could find we way home cause you know that you be in my heart and I always come home for Christmas we be live apart we be so close we be so far I will still come home for Christmas it might be just for a day but I will still come home for Christmas oh how I wish I could stay but the year slip away I come home for Christmas and I will always come home but no matter how mean this hard road treat I I always could find my way home do not you know that you be in my heart and I always come home for Christmas we be live apart we be so close we be so far I will still come home for Christmas it might be just for a day but I will still come home for Christmas oh how I wish I could stay but the year slip away I come home for Christmas and I will always come home
