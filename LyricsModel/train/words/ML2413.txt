Yankee soldier 
he want to shoot some skag 
he meet it in Cambodia 
but now he can not afford a bag 
Yankee dollar talk 
to the dictator of the world 
in fact it be give order 
and they can not afford to miss a word 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
but what can I do 
Yankee detective 
be always on the tv 
because killer in America 
work seven day a week 
never mind the star and stripe 
let 's play the Watergate Tapes 
I will salute the New Wave 
and I hope nobody escape 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
but what can I do 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
but what can I do 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
I be so bored with the U.S.A 
but what can I do 
move up Starsky 
for the C.I.A 
suck on Kojak 
for the USA
