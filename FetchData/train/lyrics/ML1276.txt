So you tell me that I am a lucky man
You're so right, yes you're so right
Girl you know, there is no other place I'd be right now
Holding hands with my baby
So I'm going to love you until the sun comes up
Be that extra sugar you need in your cup
From this love
There's no holiday
From this love
We won't take a break no
From this love
There's no holiday
From this love
We won't take a break no
Not a day goes by when it's me alone
Like a soldier, can't wait to come back home
And to let you know every man on earth wished they had you
For their special lady
So am going to love you until the sun comes up
You're that extra sugar I need in my cup
From this love
There's no holiday
From this love
We won't take a break no
From this love
There's no holiday
From this love
We won't take a break no
So you tell me that I am a lucky man
You're so right, yes you're so right
Girl you know, there is no other place I'd be right now
Holding hands with my baby
So I'm going to love you until the sun comes up
Be that extra sugar you need in your cup
From this love
There's no holiday
From this love
We won't take a break no
From this love
There's no holiday
From this love
We won't take a break no
