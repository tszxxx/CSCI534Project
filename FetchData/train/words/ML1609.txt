down the stair to the stone house golden light , oh what a fight another sleepless night , she dress be filigree she tell I all she secret then I be back on the street it 's hard , oh it 's hard to help yourself when you do not know where to begin it 's the devil , it 's the boil , it 's the black of night in you head , in you head do you see the fire heavy light before it 's time ? know you the color of the end of the end of the end Silence be dancing to a beat drum money be nothing but a load gun and it 's hard , oh it 's hard to help yourself when you do not know where to begin it 's the devil , it 's the boil , it 's the black of night in you head , in you head it 's hard , oh it 's hard to help yourself when you do not know where to begin it 's the devil , it 's the boil , it 's the black of night in you head , in you head and it 's hard , oh it 's hard to help yourself when you do not know where to begin in the midst of a moment can you break the bull ? can you tame the demon ? light a candle in the dark , in the dark , in dark in the dark , light a candle in the dark , in dark in dark , in dark , oh in the dark , light a candle in the dark in dark , in dark , in dark
