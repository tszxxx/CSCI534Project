[Verse 1]
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there
[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
[Interlude]
Think about it
[Verse 2]
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying
[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
[Interlude]
Just think about it
[Bridge]
Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh lord, there must be something you can say
[Verse 3]
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'cos she didn't fit in there
[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
[Outro]
Just think about it
Mhm
Think about it
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
(Para-, paradise)
Paradise
Uh, just think about it
Paradise
Just think about it
(Para-, paradise)
Uh, in Paradise
Mhm, paradise
Paradise
