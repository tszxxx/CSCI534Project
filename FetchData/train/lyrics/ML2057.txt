[Verse 1]
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel
Left all alone
[Verse 2]
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long &amp; winding road
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
[Verse 3]
You know that I've seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights, falling off
The silver screen
[Verse 4]
My hearts like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
[Outro]
Um, I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeah... I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
