[Verse 1]
I should be calling collect from jail
For the things I commit each night in my head
Like last night in my sleep I got to snuff you
But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes and you just vanish
Soon as I lay down my head when I'm dead
To the whole wide world
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
And then I wake up and it was all just a dream
And everything is the same
[Chours]
Sleepwalker, did I give you concrete shoes?
And throw you off of a bridge
Sleepwalker, when I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul's mine to keep
, I feel you near me
Go to sleep, sleepwalker
Just taking a stroll, don't go to sleep
Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!
[Verse 2]
You always make an excellent cadaver
I roll your body up in a carpet
To make music in the trunk of my limousine
Wrapped up in a rug
A fitting end is that I send you up the river like a punk
No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life
The angel of death is pissed off at me again
Just because I got to put you out of my misery
It doesn't matter, I am without fear
Now you're dead, I won't shed another bloody tear for you
No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life
I'm calling down the thunder, 
then you'll sleep with the fishes
The answer to all of my wishes
[Chours]
Sleepwalker, did I tell you I was in movies?
Then dump you garroted
, lying naked in a ditch
Sleepwalker, every day, another way, I know you can hear me
[Solo - Mustaine]
[Solo - Drover]
[Verse 3]
I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear
No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life
And then I wake up and it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same
[Chours]
Sleepwalker, did I give you concrete shoes?
And throw your body off of a bridge
Sleepwalker, when I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul's mine to keep, I feel you near me
Sleepwalker, or did I tell you I was in movies?
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch
Sleepwalker, every day, another way, I know you can hear me
Sleepwalker, 
did I buy you the farm?
Put a horse head in your bed
Sleepwalker, when I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I feel you near me
Sleepwalker, every day, every day another way
Sleepwalker, when I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I know you can hear me
