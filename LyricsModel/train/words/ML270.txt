I be not skilled to understand 
what God have will what God have plan 
I only know at he right hand 
stand one who be my savior 
I take he at he word and deed 
Christ die to save I this I read 
and in my heart I find the need 
of he to be my savior 
that he would leave he place on high 
and come for sinful man to die 
you call it strange so once do I 
before I know my savior

my strength my solace from the spring 
that he who live to be my king 
once die to be my savior 
that he would leave he place on high 
and come for sinful man to die 
you call it strange so once do I 
before I know my savior
