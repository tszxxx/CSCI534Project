as I stand alone on this mournful night 
for the first time I feel alone in light 
as I watch the moon kiss the starlit sky 
I feel the need for you lip to press close to mine 
for so long I have be afraid to love 
but right now I feel the need for love 
and you you have a love 
a love I need oh to comfort I 
ooh and I be ready for love 
I be truly ready for love 
you wonderful sweet sweet love 
right now I be ready for love 
I have try to shield my heart from love 's tender touch 
cause to lose in love would hurt so much 
but as I softly walk in my solitude 
I search my heart and find there be a need for you 
and for the first time I feel alone 
cause I need a love to call my own 
and only you you have a love 
a love I need oh to comfort I 
ooh and I be ready for love I be truly ready for love 
you know I be ready for love 
you wonderful sweet sweet love 
ooh something wonderful have come over I 
and fill this heart of mine with ecstasy 
I be glad I have finally open up my eye 
and push the fear of love the fear of love aside 
and for the first time I feel alive 
I have the touch of love deep down inside 
and just as soon as I see you smile face 
I will rush into you warm embrace 
right now I be ready for love 
I be truly ready for love 
you wonderful sweet sweet love 
right now I be ready for love 
you know I be ready for love 
you wonderful sweet sweet love 
right now I be ready for love
