it be Christmas now 
this be when we see all the angel 
dance in the sky above just for we 
it be Christmas day 
something to believe in 
I believe the love that we feel for each other 
be he gift to we 
and nothing will keep we apart 
if we love with a Christmas heart 
it be Christmas now 
this be when the eye of we child 
search into these eye of ours 
how sweet they be 
what kind of world be we go to leave they 
what we could not learn from each other 
we still can learn from God 
what a way to live what a place to start 
bless we please with a Christmas heart 
and with this heart we will share 
so those who count upon we can know we love and know we care
