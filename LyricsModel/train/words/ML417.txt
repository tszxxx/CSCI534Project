true in this modern world when two lover get together 
chance of them ever make it to forever 
could not be better than two in a million heart 
girl this be not just another run of the mill emotion 
what I be feel be the definition of devotion 
my love for you be true 
true like the sun come up each morning 
Bright as the light in a baby 's smile 
sure as a mountain river wind 
right as the rain fall from the sky 
girl my love for you be true 
true not another minute on this Earth can be borrow 
so there be no way to know when I will live my last tomorrow 
but everyday I get I will share with you 
this feeling just keep get stronger as the time go by 
it be write on my face you can see it in my eye 
my love for you be true
