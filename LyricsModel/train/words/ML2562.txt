get no time to be on the run 
get no hole in my shoe 
you be the reasong all my friend have go 
but I will not run from you 
so many promise and you break they all 
oh I will forgive but I can not forget 
you know you be a fake but I just can not take no more 
cause I be tired of it 
I be so tired so tired 
sick and tired of it all 
I be so tired sick and tired 
I be so tired sick and tired of it all yeah 
you turn the truth then you turn you back 
you be a victim of yourself 
the hate remain the hurt still exist 
I be so tired of it all 
I be so tired sick and tired 
so damn tired sick and tired of it all oh yeah 
I be so tired I be sick and tired of it all
