Said the nightman to the little lamb do you see what I see Way up in the sky , little lamb do you see what I see a star , a star dancing in the night with a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepard boy do you hear what I hear ringing through the sky , shepard boy do you hear what I hear a song , a song high above the tree with a voice as big as the sea Said the shepard boy the mighty king do you know what I know in you palace warm , mighty king do you know what I know a child , a child shiver in the cold let we bring he silver a gold let we bring he silver and gold Said the king to the people everywhere Listen to what I say pray for peace , people everywhere Listen to what I say a child , a child sleeping in the night he will bring we goodness and light
