well you be the real tough cookie with a long history 
of break little heart like the one in I 
that be okay let 's see how you do it 
put up you duke 
let 's get down to it 
hit I with you best shot 
why do not you hit I with you best shot 
hit I with you best shot 
Fire away

that be okay see if I care 
knock I down it be all in vain 
I get right back on my foot again 
hit I with you best shot 
why do not you hit I with you best shot 
hit I with you best shot 
Fire away 
well you be the real tough cookie 
with a long history 
of break little heart like the one in I 
before I put another notch in my lipstick case 
you better make sure you put I in my place 
hit I with you best shot 
c'mon hit I with you best shot 
hit I with you best shot 
Fire away 
hit I with you best shot 
why do not you hit I with you best shot 
hit I with you best shot 
Fire away
