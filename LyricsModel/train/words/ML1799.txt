some modest dream they just do not pay out 
some modest means do not leave much way out 
in every cradle there be a grave now 
in every owner there be a slave now 
Heard somewhere that there be a place now 
someone who will catch you on you way dow and 
but in every captain there be a kid now 
in every chaplain there be a id now 
so make sure you keep you bunk bed make 
one day you will see you bunker wall degrade 
and in every garden there be a snake now 
in every pardon there be mistake now 
when you fall on the ground 
not a sound army bound 
when you be all no account 
no amount army bound 
when you vest or you gown 
Hand I down army bound 
when what be next look unsound 
shaky ground army bound 
work hard for a round 
to the crown army bound 
while you march from you town 
to renown army bound
