[Instrumental Intro]
Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgement Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave
One last look at visions of flesh
The last ? hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone
Elysian fields
, we are storming the heavens
Elysian fields
, to raise the swords and shields
Elysian fields
, we ascend to our destiny
Elysian fields
, to the Elysian fields
Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones
One last look at visions of flesh
The last blessed hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone
Elysian fields
, we are storming the heavens
Elysian fields
, to raise the swords and shields
Elysian fields
, we ascend to our destiny
Elysian fields
, to the Elysian fields
