[Verse 1]
You pretend you're high
Pretend you're bored
Pretend you're anything
Just to be adored
And what you need
Is what you get
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in faith
Don't believe in anything
That you can't break
[Chorus]
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had, you wasted
All you had, you wasted
[Verse 2]
What drives you on (drives you on)
Can drive you mad (drive you mad)
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't believe in love
Don't believe in hate
Don't believe in anything
That you can't waste
[Chorus]
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it
[Instrumental break]
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in pain
Don't believe in anyone
That you can't tame
[Chorus]
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had, you wasted
All you had, you wasted
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
I can't believe you fake it
I can't believe you fake it
Stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it
[Outro]
You stupid girl
