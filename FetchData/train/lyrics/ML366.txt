[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Verse 2]
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
[Chorus]
And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
[Outro]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
