I think that dream belong to other I and 
cause each time I get close 
they would fall apart again 
I fear my heart would beat in secrecy 
I face the night alone 
oh how could I have know and 
that all my life 
I only need you 
oh 
almost paradise 
we be knock on heaven 's door 
almost paradise 
how could we ask for more 
I swear that I can see 
forever in you eye 
paradise 
it seem like perfect 
love be so hard to find 
I would almost give up 
you must have read my mind 
and all these dream 
I save for a rainy day 
they be finally come true 
I will share they all with you 
cause now we hold the 
Future in we hand 
and in you arm 
salvation be not so far away 
we be get closer 
closer every day 
paradise 
paradise
