until you find the one you want to want you 
until you find she eye constantly haunt you 
until no other lip can ever thrill you 
you will never know the glory of a heart in love 
until you be sweep away with a emotion 
as high as star above as great as the ocean 
do not say you have be in love for it be not true 
until you love someone as I love you 
until you find the one 
as high as star above 
do not say you have be in love for it be not true 
until you love someone as I love you
