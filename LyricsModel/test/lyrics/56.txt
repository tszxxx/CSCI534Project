I tried to write it in calligraphy
But the words wouldn't come to me
Couldn't send it in a telegram
Or sculpt it like Rodan
If I could think the words across the sky
Cuz when we touch I feel like I can fly
I couldn't build another Taj Mahal
But music says it all
Brown eyes, let my
guitar gently groove you
Like rain, falls down
Surrender to the sound
Feel my six play
Caress you in today
Strum you like you are
A mahogany guitar
We mix the six play
Flip it a million ways
Spend your every fantasy
Your desire's fulfilled by my song
Makin love till the symphonic dawn
Got a private show that's sure to floor ya
My guitar is cryin for ya
Stay
Enjoy my six play
Six play, Six play
We could drift into a fantasy
Two lovers walkin on a emerald sea
Check the music, let it set your free
Be the girl you wanna be
Never felt the beat quite like this
I never had a dance quite like this
Never played guitar quite like this
Aww baby
Brown eyes, let my
guitar gently groove you
Like rain, falls down
Surrender to the sound
Feel my six play
Caress you in today
Strum you like you are
A mahogany guitar
We mix the six play
Flip it a million ways
Spend your every fantasy
Your desire's fulfilled by my song
Makin love till the symphonic dawn
Got a private show that's sure to floor ya
My guitar is cryin for ya
Stay
Enjoy my six play
Pull up a chair this is a private affair
We can work it our GB gonna show you what its about
There aint nothin better than us chillin out together
With a song from my heart
Six play, Six play
Feel my six play
Caress you in today
Strum you like you are
A mahogany guitar
We mix the six play
Flip it a million ways
Spend your every fantasy
Your desire's fulfilled by my song
Makin love till the symphonic dawn
Got a private show that's sure to floor ya
My guitar is cryin for ya
Stay
Enjoy my six play
