I get away just for a while 
I get to pine I get to cry 
be without you 
you think my world be tumble down 
you know the reason I can not hurt 
I get a heart of stone 
I go away to meet my love 
I see thing that I can not have 
it make I mad 
to think of you with someone else 
you know the reason I can not hurt 
I get a heart of stone 
I get away just for a while 
I get to pine I get to cry 
be without you 
you think my world be tumble down 
you know the reason I can not hurt 
I get a heart of stone
