have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas let you Heart be light from now on , we trouble will be out of sight have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas make the Yuletide Gay from now on , we trouble will be Far away and here we be , as in Olden day happy golden day of Yore faithful Friends who be dear to we Gather Near to we once more through the year , we all will be together if the fates allow Hang a Shining Star upon the highest Bough and have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas now and have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas now
