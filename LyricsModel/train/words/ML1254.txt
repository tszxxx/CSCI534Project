in the depth of the deep blue sea 
there be a blue as blue as I 
where a quiet symphony play for the lonely 
I could just let it all go 
sink down to the world below 
where I do not breathe but I do not know 
cause I be breathless 
when it be love 
it will rain sometimes 
when it be love it will pour 
pour 
I do not where my lover go 
but I know that he take the rent 
and I know that he go and spend all my loving 
and I be not rich but I do not care 
I will find that boy anywhere 
I will walk the land fly the air and tread water 
when it be love 
it will rain sometimes 
when it be love it will pour 
pour 
if the moon could sing a song 
with the symphony in the blue beyond 
they would tell I he be really go forever 
when it be love 
it will rain sometimes 
when it be love it will pour 
when it be love 
it will rain sometimes 
when it be love it will pour 
pour pour pour 
it will pour 
it will pour 
it will pour
