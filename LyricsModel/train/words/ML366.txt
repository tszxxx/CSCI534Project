maybe I do not love you 
quite as often as I could have 
maybe I do not treat you 
quite as good as I should have 
if I make you feel second best 
girl I be sorry I be blind 
you be always on my mind 
you be always on my mind 
and maybe I do not hold you 
all those lonely lonely time 
and I guess I never tell you 
I be so happy that you be mine 
little thing I should have say and do 
I just never take the time 
and you be always on my mind 
you be always on my mind 
tell I tell I that you 
sweet love have not die 
and give I 
give I one more chance 
to keep you satisfied 
keep you satisfied 
little thing I should have say and do 
I just never take the time 
but you be always on my mind 
you be always on my mind
