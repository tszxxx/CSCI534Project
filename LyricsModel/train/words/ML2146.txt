I get mad at history 
pick it up and fall in love with everything 
man and pen and paper 
like the wind you let them in now they will never leave 
run from the gun do not be afraid 
run from the gun where the dead lay 
run from the gun do not be afraid 
run from the gun 
you be sweet as poison 
dry my mouth take I out and leave I glad 
you do I no favor 
it be dumb and the last one that I ever have 
run from the gun do not be afraid 
run from the gun where the dead lay 
run from the gun do not be afraid 
run from the gun 
it be load with the pressure 
too much pressure to be measure 
I be hold off the wrong and the right 
I get let down gently 
never even know the end be on the way 
then I make my peace there 
open eye and my surprise it be a waste 
run from the gun do not be afraid 
run from the gun where the dead lay 
run from the gun do not be afraid 
run from the gun
