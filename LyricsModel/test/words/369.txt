and now the end be near so I face the final curtain my friend , I will say it clear I will state my case of which I be certain I have live a life that 's full I have travel each and every highway and more , much more than this I do it my way regret , I have have a few but then again , too few to mention I do what I have to do and see it through without exception I plan each chart course each careful step along the byway oh , and more , much more than this I do it my way yes , there be time , I be sure you know when I bit off more than I could chew but through it all when there be doubt I eat it up and spit it out I face it all and I stand tall and do it my way I have love , I have laugh and cry I have have my fill , my share of lose and now as tear subside I find it all so amusing to think I do all that and may I say , not in a shy way oh , no , no not I I do it my way for what be a man , what have he get if not himself , then he have not to say the word he truly feel and not the word of one who kneel the record show I take the blow and do it my way the record show I take the blow and do it my way
