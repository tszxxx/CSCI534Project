butterfly before they fly 
they never doubt the beauty that await inside 
like a flower reach out reach for the sun 
they do not compare theirselves to anyone 
and I wonder why we do 
so do not try too hard now be who you be now 
you have get to let it shine 
beauty have no face no color no race child 
beauty be inside 
in you eye I see you light 
shine from you heart when you do not even try 
so just be yourself cause there be no one else 
no one else like you there be not nobody in this world it be true 
so let you light come through 
so do not try too hard now be who you be now 
you have get to let it shine 
beauty have no face no color no race child 
beauty be inside 
beauty be inside 
there be more than what meet the eye 
much more than on the outside 
it be something that be deep inside 
you will not find it on a movie screen or page of a magazine 
much more than the eye can see 
do not try too hard now be who you be now 
you have get to let it shine 
beauty have no face no color no race child 
beauty be inside 
do not try too hard now be who you be now 
you have get to let it shine
