I I love the colorful clothes she wear 
and the way the sunlight play upon she hair 
I hear the sound of a gentle word 
on the wind that lift she perfume through the air

Softly smile I know she must be kind 
when I look in she eye

I be pickin up good vibration 
she be give I excitation 
I be pickin up good vibration
