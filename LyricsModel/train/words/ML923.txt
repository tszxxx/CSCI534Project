chorus 
I have be lonely for so long 
do not seem like happiness will come along 
I have be lonely for so long 
do not seem like happiness will come along 
these be not rain cloud over my head 
everybody be throw rock in my bed 
just can not seem to get ahead in life 
oh nothing I do ever turn out right 
will not somebody help I please 
chorus 
I lay awake every night 
try to figure out how to make thing right 
there be get to be a better way I know 
to shake this monkey off cause he be make I so 
will not somebody help I please 
chorus 
yes I know what it feel like to be lonely 
to have you friend turn they back on you 
yes I have be lonely 
to never know the real meaning of peace of mind yes 
I lay awake every night 
try to figure out how to make thing right 
there be get to be a better way I know 
to shake this monkey off cause he be make I so 
will not somebody help I please
