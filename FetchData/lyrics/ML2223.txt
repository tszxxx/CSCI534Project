[Verse]
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas for certain
[Chorus]
And when that blue blue heartache starts hurting
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
And when that blue blue heartache starts hurting
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
