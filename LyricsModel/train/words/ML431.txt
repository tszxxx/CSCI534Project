you cruel device 
you blood like ice 
one look could kill 
my pain you thrill 
I want to love you but I better not touch 
I want to hold you but my sense tell I to stop 
I want to kiss you but I want it too much 
I want to taste you but you lip be venomous poison 
you be poison run through my vein 
you be poison 
I do not want to break these chain 
you mouth so hot 
you web I be catch 
you skin so wet 
black lace on sweat 
I hear you call and it be needle and pin 
I want to hurt you just to hear you scream my name 
do not want to touch you but you be under my skin 
I want to kiss you but you lip be venomous poison 
you be poison run through my vein 
you be poison 
I do not want to break these chain 
poison 
one look could kill 
my pain you thrill 
I want to love you but I better not touch 
I want to hold you but my sense tell I to stop 
I want to kiss you but I want it too much 
I want to taste you but you lip be venomous poison 
you be poison run through my vein 
you be poison 
I do not want to break these chain 
poison 
I want to love you but I better not touch 
I want to hold you but my sense tell I to stop 
I want to kiss you but I want it too much 
I want to taste you but you lip be venomous poison

Runnin deep inside my vein 
burnin deep inside my brain
