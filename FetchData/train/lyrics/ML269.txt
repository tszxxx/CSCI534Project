Jesus, King of my heart
Father, my peace and my light
Spirit, the joy of my soul You are
Jesus, to you none compare
Father, I rest in Your care
Spirit, the hope of my heart You are
Chorus:
The heavens declare You are God
And the mountains rejoice
The oceans cry Alleluia
As we worship You Lord
For this is our Song of Love
Jesus, You save my soul
I'll thank You forevermore
Jesus, the love of my life You are
Chorus
Jesus, I am in awe
Of the love that You have shown
Jesus, how precious You are to me
Chorus
