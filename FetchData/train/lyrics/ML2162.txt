Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day
Strange, but not surprisin', nor is it unfamiliar
How it takes a death like this to bring us together
You know you'll always be my flesh and blood;
I could never do you wrong
And the one who was gone for so long is coming home
Alright...
Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying;
We are laughing and we're crying every single day
We are getting older at the blink of an eye
So, don't let the moment pass you by
I don't believe there is a greater love, one of patience and pain
Than the love between a mama and her children
In the procession down to the lighthouse
We hear the crashing of the waves, and the mistakes we made
You know that we are not the only ones, so, we can have some fun
Have some, have some, have some, have some fun
Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying;
We are laughing and we're crying every single day
Every single day
[Is] not the time to be so, to be so sad
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so, don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day
Every single day
