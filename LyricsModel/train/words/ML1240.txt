some people say 
you have get to fight for a love that be true 
climb every mountain 
see every trial and tribulation through 
I be here to tell you 
that be only half the lesson 
now if you want a girl to come to you 
you have get to leave a little room for guessin 
oh just be easy baby 
that girl will come run to you 
if you just be easy baby 
she will be easy too 
do not you know it be just a fool who play the part 
run a girl down like she be a game in a school yard 
now if she wait you should turn and let she alone 
and she will come to you just as sure as you be bear 
be easy baby 
that girl will come run to you 
if you just be easy baby 
she will be easy too 
do not you know 
a woman do not want a man down on he knee 
run she down like a mouse at the cheese 
you have get to be mettle if you want she affection 
get too excited and she be off in another direction 
so be easy baby 
that girl will come run to you 
if you just be easy baby 
she will be easy too
