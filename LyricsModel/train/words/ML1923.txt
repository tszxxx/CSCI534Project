the day 's do 
she will not listen 
she will not listen 
my head 's numb 
and I can not hear she 
any clearer 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cruise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cruise 
my alien 
he be still missing 
he be still missing 
my brain 's numb 
and I can not hear ya 
any clearer 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cruise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise 
Cru-cruise 
wipe all the sweat from my eye 
and hide from the ocean 
wafe crush my flesh and skull 
but I still feel stupid stupid stupid stupid 
stupid stupid 
stupid stupid 
stupid stupid 
stupid stupid
