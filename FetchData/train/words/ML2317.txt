once there be a way to get back homeward once there be a way to get back home sleep pretty darling , do not cry and I will sing a lullaby golden slumber fill you eye Smiles await you when you rise sleep pretty darling , do not cry and I will sing a lullaby once there be a way to get back homeward once there be a way to get back home sleep pretty darling , do not cry and I will sing a lullaby
