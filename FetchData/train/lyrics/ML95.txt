[Refrain/Intro]
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
So satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
So satisfied I'm on my way
I. Your Move
[Verse 1]
Take a straight and stronger course
To the corner of your life
Make the white queen run so fast
She hasn't got time to make you a wife
[Chorus]
Cause it's time, it's time in time with your time
And its news is captured
For the queen to use
[Verse 2]
Move me on to any black square
Use me any time you want
Just remember that the goal
Is for us all to capture only one, anywhere
Yea, yea, yea
[Chorus]
Don't surround yourself with yourself
Move on back two squares
Send an Instant Karma to me
Initial it with loving care
Don't surround yourself
Cause his time is time, in time with your time
And its news is captured
For the queen to use
[Bridge]
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit
Didda
[Chorus]
Don't surround yourself with yourself
Move on back two squares
Send an Instant Karma to me
Initial it with loving care
Don't surround yourself with yourself
Cause it's time, it's time in time with your time
And its news is captured
For the queen to use
[Bridge]
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(All we are saying)
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(Is give peace a chance)
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(All we are saying)
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(Is give peace a chance)
Cause it's time, it's time in time with your time
And its news is captured
