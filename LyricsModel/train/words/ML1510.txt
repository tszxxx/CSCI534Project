this forest 
be grow faster than I can tell 
cell structure 
eat away at a massive swell 
seem however 
I be a victim of circumstance 
hunt for 
ogre and dwarf 
lion slicer 
run 
with 
death 
run 
with 
death 
white face 
come closer with every step 
Earth envelope 
take breath without happenstance 
carve my tooth out 
rip through the sheep 's head curse 
Hunter 
gatherer 
ride from the cave 
run 
with 
death 
run 
with 
death 
go away 
my heart be go away 
take everything 
my heart be go away 
take it now 
run 
with 
death 
run 
with 
death 
go away 
my heart be go away 
take everything 
my heart be go away 
take it now
