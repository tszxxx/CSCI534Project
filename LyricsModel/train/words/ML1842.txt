Thunder through the darkness 
the curse of war have come 
a armoured force invade 
serenity undone 
disciple of pure hatred 
like lightning they attack 
the carry a torch of evil 
the flame that burn black 
sign in blood 
a pact be make 
destruction and murder have come 
with blister pace 
let battle commence 
armoured assault have begin 
cite burn in flame 
only ruin remain 
Blood stain the earth 
defender fight in vain 
crush all before they 
with metal armour might 
futile prayer for mercy 
unanswered in the fight 
sign in blood 
a pact be make 
destruction and murder have come 
with blister pace 
let battle commence 
armoured assault have begin 
lock in bitter conflict 
leg devastation begin 
the iron fist of evil 
condemn you and you kin 
destruction of subhuman race 
innocent shall die 
the plague of war corrupt the earth 
Theyâ€™re fight for a lie 
sign in blood 
a pact be make 
destruction and murder have come 
with blister pace 
let battle commence 
armoured assault have begin
