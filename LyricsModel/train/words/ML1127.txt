maybe I could fall 
baby I could fall apart 
to conceal to protect to serve and to reject 
I be turn into something 
go all the way to the right 
I be go past I be go past I be go past the next two light 
Chorus 
hit the street 
they talk to I 
a fickle beast who be nice today 
it be such a waste another day 
such a waste but it feel great 
but it feel great 
it feel great 
everything have take a turn 
in disguise as what I want 
I can leave she 
I cantilever 
but I keep come back for more 
I be turn into something 
go all the way to the right 
I be go past I be go past I be go past the next two light 
chorus x 2 
but it feel great today 
it may be a waste 
another day 
it feel great 
it may be a waste 
another day 
but it feel great 
it feel great
