Walkin' with my baby she's got great big feet
She's long, lean and lanky ain't had nothing to eat
But she's my baby. And I love her just the same
Crazy 'bout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name
Caldonia!  Caldonia!
What makes your big head so hard?
Ma, I love you, love you just the same
I"ll always love you babe, 'cause Caldonia is your name
You know, my mama told me to leave Caldonia alone?
That's what she told me, no kidding. That's what she said
She said,"Son, keep away from that woman, she's ain't no good. Don't bother her. "
But mama didn't know what Caldonia was putting down
So am going down to Caledonia's house and ask her just one more time
Caldonia! Caldonia!
What makes your big head so hard?
Ma
