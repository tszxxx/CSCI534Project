if you be in my heart I would surely not break you 
if you be beside I and my love would take you 
I would keep you in safety forever protect you 
I will hide you away from the world you reject 
I will hide you 
I will hide you 
take my hand 
show you feel 
look in my eye 
it be perfectly clear 
I love you and cover you 
ask I to tell you what I want to do 
I will hide you 
away from danger danger danger 
if you be in my heart I would surely not break you 
if you be beside I and my love would take you 
I would keep you in safety forever protect you 
I will hide you away from the world you reject 
I will hide you 
I will hide you 
take my hand 
show you feel 
look in my eye 
it be perfectly clear 
I love you and cover you 
ask I to tell you what I want to do 
I will hide you 
away from danger danger danger 
if you be in my heart I would surely not break you 
if you be beside I and my love would take you 
I would keep you in safety forever protect you 
I will hide you away from the world you reject 
I will hide you 
I will hide you 
if you be in my heart I would surely not break you 
if you be beside I and my love would take you 
I would keep you in safety forever protect you 
I will hide you away from the world you reject 
I will hide you 
I will hide you
