I once know a girl in the year of my youth with eye like the summer all beauty and truth in the morning I fleed leave a note and it read Someday you will be love I can not pretend that I feel any regret cause each break heart will eventually mend as the blood run red down the needle and thread Someday you will be love you will be love , you will be love like you never have know n and the memory of I will seem more like bad dream just a series of blur like I never occur Someday you will be love you may feel alone when you be fall asleep every time tear roll down you cheek but I know you heart belong to someone you have yet to meet Someday you will be love you will be love , you will be love like you never have know n and the memory of I will seem more like bad dream just a series of blur like I never occur Someday you will be love you will be love , you will be love like you never have know n and the memory of I will seem more like bad dream just a series of blur like I never occur Someday you will be love Someday you will be love
