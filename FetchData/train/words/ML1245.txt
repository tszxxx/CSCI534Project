you take the skyway , high above the busy little one - way in my stupid hat and glove , at night I lie awake Wonderin ' if I will sleep Wonderin ' if we will meet out in the street but you take the skyway it do not move at all like a subway it 's get bum when it 's cold like any other place , it 's warm up inside Sittin ' down and waitin ' for a ride beneath the skyway oh , then one day , I see you walkin ' down that little one - way where the place I would catch my ride most everyday there be not a damn thing I could do or say up in the skyway in skyway skyway
