[Verse 1]
Soon time for a cleaning day
Onward rode the van
Swept in by discolored waste
Sickness crept on the hall
And the death of me
Almost as we burn and play
[Chorus]
Ants just don't belong
In this place you call your own
[Verse 2]
Searching for a favorite flower
Narrow with the hall
Swept in by discolored waste
Almost as we burn and play
[Chorus]
Ants just don't belong
In this place you call your own
[Outro]
Danger's taller trees
Don't look so good to me
They won't grow again
Led to final peace
And this diluted stream
They don't break for them
