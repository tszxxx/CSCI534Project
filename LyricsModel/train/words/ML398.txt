will we be together again 
think the love we have be strong 
tell I what be on 
where do we go wrong 
will I will I will I 
will I will I will I 
will I ever love you again 
will we be together again 
think the love we have be strong 
tell I what be on 
where do we go wrong 
will I ever love you again 
will we be together again 
think the love we have be strong 
tell I what be on 
where do we go wrong
