[Verse 1]
I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yea I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouthed bass have got me hooked on Sunday afternoons
[Chorus]
Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud Honky Tonk that rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most
[Verse 2]
Man I love how Redman tastes
Dam I love my Nascar race
Any song sung by George Strait is country at it's best
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Yea I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken torn up jeans
My 4-wheel drive and 8 point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And Jack D in my Coke
But honey I love your love
Yea I love your love
[Outro]
I love your love the most[x2]
