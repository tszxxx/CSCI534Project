for fear my eye be close 
I will shut this out no more embrace this 
and I become the catalyst 
and now it swell in I 
smash all my defense down 
I will take this 
I will let this fire consume I 
I will not I will not 
I will not fall I will not fail 
I pound the wall I shake the cage 
I will not fall I will not fail 
let the fire consume I 
this burn passion it fill I with desire 
and drive I and it drive my cause 
I be fill with reason but reason drive I further 
disdain for disbelief will stay the course 
oh let the fire consume I 
let the fire burn 
let the courage flow through I 
let the fire burn 
I pound the wall I shake the cage 
I will not fall I will not fail 
I pound the wall I shake the cage 
I will not fall I will not fail 
oh let the fire consume I 
let the fire burn 
let the courage flow through I 
let the fire burn 
let the fire consume I
