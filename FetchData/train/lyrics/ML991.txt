[Verse]
Rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go
Making up things to do
Not running in all directions
Trying to find you
I'm just rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go
[Chorus] [x2]
And I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
When there's loneliness all around
I've got to keep going
Traveling down this lonesome road
I'll be rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go
