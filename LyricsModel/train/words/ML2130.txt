feel the pressure let it go 
feel the pressure let it go 
you try to buy some time 
can not read the sign or the reason why 
every single time 
like you be drive blind 
can not make up my mind 
I know I be go to find my way out 
crash 
you be go down 
without a sound 
then I will pass you up 
before I explode 
break into 
I will see it through 
you will not keep I down 
when I crash through you 
so here we be right now 
this be we time 
to cross this line 
every single time 
like you be drive blind 
can not make up my mind 
I know I be go to find my way out 
crash 
you be go down 
without a sound 
then I will pass you up 
before I explode 
break into 
I will see it through 
you will not keep I down 
when I crash through you 
I will crash through you 
hear I out 
I be never backin down 
I be never backin down 
hear I out 
I be never backin down 
I know you goin down 
crash 
you be go down 
without a sound 
then I will pass you up 
I be not go to 
crash 
and burn away 
I will rise today 
will not break I down 
when I crash through you 
crash 
you be go down 
without a sound 
then I will pass you up 
before I explode 
break into 
I will see it through 
you will not keep I down 
when I crash through

I will crash through you 
I will crash through you 
I will crash through you 
feel the pressure let it go 
feel the pressure let it go 
feel the pressure let it go
