I want to live I want to give 
I have be a miner for a heart of gold 
it be these expression I never give 
that keep I searchin for a heart of gold 
and I be get old 
keep I searchin for a heart of gold 
and I be get old

I cross the ocean for a heart of gold 
I have be in my mind it be such a fine line 
that keep I searchin for a heart of gold 
and I be get old 
keep I searchin for a heart of gold 
and I be get old 
keep I searchin for a heart of gold 
you keep I searchin and I be grow old 
keep I searchin for a heart of gold 
I have be a miner for a heart of gold
