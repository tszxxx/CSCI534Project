intro 
I use to be such a sweet sweet thing 
til they get a hold of I 
I open door for little old lady 
I help the blind to see 
I get no friend cause they read the papers 
they can not be see with I and I be gettin real shot down 
and I be feel mean 
no more Mister Nice guy 
no more Mister Clean 
no more Mister Nice guy 
they say he be sick he be obscene 
instrumental 
I get no friend cause they read the papers 
they can not be see with I and I be feelin real shot down 
and I be gettin mean 
no more Mister Nice guy 
no more Mister Clean 
no more Mister Nice guy 
they say he be sick he be obscene 
my dog bit I on the leg today 
my cat claw my eye 
ma be be throw out of the social circle 
and dad have to hide 
I go to church incognito 
when everybody rise the Reverend Smith 
he recognize I 
and punch I in the nose he say 
no more Mister Nice guy 
no more Mister Clean 
no more Mister Nice guy 
he say you be sick you be obscene 
no more Mister Nice guy 
no more Mister Clean 
no more Mister Nice guy 
he say you be sick you be obscene
