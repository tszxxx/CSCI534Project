sleep and dream of this 
death angel 's kiss 
bring final bliss 
come believe I 
empty they say 
death will not you let I stay 
empty they say 
death hear I call you name 
oh call you name 
suicide I have already die 
you be just the funeral I have be wait for 
cyanide live dead inside 
break this empty shell forevermore 
wait wait patiently 
you death black wing 
unfold sleep 
spread of 'er I 
empty they say 
death will not you let I stay 
empty they say 
death hear I call you name 
oh call you name 
suicide I have already die 
it be just the funeral I have be wait for 
cyanide live dead inside 
break this empty shell forevermore 
say be that rain or be they tear 
that stain you concrete face for year 
the crying weeping shed strife 
year after year life after life 
a air of freshly break ground 
a concrete angel lay right down 
upon the grave which swallow fast 
it be peace at last 
of peace at last 
empty they say 
death will not you let I stay 
empty they say 
death hear I call you name 
oh call you name 
suicide I have already die 
you be just the funeral I have be wait for 
cyanide live dead inside 
break this empty shell forevermore 
Forevermore 
Forevermore 
it be the funeral I have be wait for
