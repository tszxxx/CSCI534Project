Lord know I have try 
to do what be right 
one whole year of stayin home 
both day and night 
cause I smell a mean trouble 
Way over yonder 
you know I hear a mean yeah 
always in trouble people 
Lord they just will not let I be 
the people talk about I 
both night and day 
I say Lord please forgive they 
and go the other way 
cause I smell a mean trouble 
Lord I smell trouble 
ahead of I oh yeah 
yes always in trouble 
Lord they just will not let I be 
and from now on 
I will not run and hide 
I will face trouble with a smile 
and hope it pass I by 
cause I smell a mean trouble 
Way over yonder 
I say I hear a mean 
yes always in trouble 
they just will not 
they just will not 
Lord they just will not 
let I be 
hoo oh yeah
