well , you wonder why I always dress in black why you never see bright color on my back and why do my appearance seem to have a somber tone well , there 's a reason for the thing that I have on I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down live in the hopeless , hungry side of town I wear it for the prisoner who have long pay for he crime but be there because he 's a victim of the time I wear the black for those who have never read or listen to the word that Jesus say about the road to happiness through love and charity why , you would think he 's talk straight to you and I well , we be do mighty fine , I do suppose in we streak of lightning car and fancy clothes but just so we be remind of the one who be hold back up front there ought to be a man in black I wear it for the sick and lonely old for the reckless one whose bad trip leave they cold I wear the black in mourn for the life that could have be each week we lose a hundred fine young man and , I wear it for the thousand who have die believe that the Lord be on they side I wear it for another hundred thousand who have die believe that we all be on they side well , there 's thing that never will be right I know and thing need change everywhere you go but ' till we start to make a move to make a few thing right you will never see I wear a suit of white ah , I would love to wear a rainbow every day and tell the world that everything 's okay but I will try to carry off a little darkness on my back until thing be brighter , I be the man in Black
