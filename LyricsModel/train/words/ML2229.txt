young girl by you side 
she ask no question 
so you do not lie 
how effortless it can be 
she feel lucky 
and you be free 
I should not have love 
I should not have love you that way 
I should not have love 
I should not have love you still 
should not have love 
should not have love you that way 
you that way you that way 
and now it be be two year 
do they know you still come here 
and day give in to night 
and then guilty morning light 
should not have love 
should not have love I that way 
should not have love 
should not have love I still 
should not have love 
should not have love I that way 
I that way I that way 
should not have love 
should not have love you that way 
should not have love 
should not have love you still 
should not have love 
should not have love you that way 
you that way you that way 
you that way
