[Intro]
Two, three...
[Chorus]
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, hoo
Girl, you know the reason why
[Verse 1]
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, hoo
Girl, you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
[Chorus]
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, hoo
Girl, you know the reason why
[Verse 2]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
[Chorus]
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
[Verse 3]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
[Chorus]
Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
