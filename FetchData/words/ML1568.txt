I sit here on the stair and listen to the night time as the daylight fade away it 's such a haunt and familiar tune when I hear it in the distance I can say that I be home , in Massachusetts where my daughter and my wife they wait for I all alone , but the truth be it 's where I always be , it 's where I long to be because I be home the North shore be where my father life I wear my Red sox hat around the world with pride but the Berkshires be where my heart be and when I see they in the distance I could cry because I be home , in Massachusetts where my daughter and my wife they wait for I all alone , but the truth be it 's where I always be , it 's where I long to be Nyla start pre-school , and Indie just turn two and Zoe 's just the perfect mix of I and you they keep get older , and time keep go by to think about it make you daddy want to cry so I just pass the sign that welcome I to Worthington establish long before this country come to be a place that hasnâ€™t really change with time the way this country that I love , it use to be because I be home , in Massachusetts where my daughter and my wife they wait for I all alone , but the truth be it 's where I always be , it 's where I long to be because I be home , in Massachusetts where my hero teach class everyday where my friend , do not treat I different it 's where my family be , it 's where I will always stay because I be home
