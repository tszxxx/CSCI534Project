white riot I want to riot

black man get a lotta problem 
but they do not mind throwin a brick 
white people go to school 
where they teach you how to be real thick 
everybody be doin 
just what they be tell to 
and nobody want 
to go to jail 
white riot I want to riot 
white riot a riot of my own 
white riot I want to riot 
white riot a riot of my own 
all the power 's in the hand 
of the people rich enough to buy it 
while we walk the street 
too chicken to even try it 
everybody be doin 
just what they be tell to 
and nobody want 
to go to jail 
white riot I want to riot 
white riot a riot of my own 
white riot I want to riot 
white riot a riot of my own 
be ya' takin over 
or be ya' takin order 
be ya' goin backwards 
or be ya' goin forward 
white riot I want to riot 
white riot a riot of my own 
white riot I want to riot 
white riot a riot of my own
