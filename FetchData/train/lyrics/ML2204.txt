[Verse 1]
What this world needs is not another one hit wonder with an axe to grind
Another two bit politician peddling lies
Another three ring circus society
What this world needs is not another sign waving super saint that's better than you
Another ear pleasing candy man afraid of the truth
Another prophet in an armani suit
[Chorus]
What this world needs is a savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love them in their time of need
A savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love
That's what this world needs
[Verse 2]
What this world needs is for us to care more about the inside than the outside
Have we become so blind that we can't see
God's gotta change her heart before he changes her shirt
What this world needs is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance
Blending in so well that people can't see the difference
And it's the difference that sets the world free
[Chorus]
[Outro]
What this world needs is a savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love them in their time of need
A savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love
That's what this world needs
Jesus is our savior, that's what this world needs
Father's arms around you, that's what this world needs
That's what this world needs
