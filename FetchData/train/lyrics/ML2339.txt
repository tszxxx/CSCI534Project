[Chorus:]
Diamonds, roses
I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness
Part this Red River
 of pain
I don't necessarily buy
Any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun
Sometimes or I think I will die
Everywhere is somewhere
And nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody
With their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure
In the corner over here
With an empty apartment
And a best friend who is a queer
Every time I see him he smiles
And he tells me how well he's walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually
[Chorus]
Diamonds, roses
I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness
Part this Red River
 of pain
Everywhere is somewhere
And nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody
With their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
Go home to an empty apartment
And call a best friend who is a queer
[Chorus]
Diamonds, roses
I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness
Part this Red River
 of pain
