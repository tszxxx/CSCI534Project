people see rock and roll as as youth culture and when youth culture become monopolise by big business what be the youth to do do you do you have any idea 
I think we should destroy the bogus capitalist process that be destroy youth culture 
when I look at you heaven be on fire 
I wish I do not know you better but it be pointless 
one look at you and heaven 's on fire 
when I look at you I reach for a piano wire 
fight to keep it together but it be pointless 
one look at you and heaven 's on fire 
Heaven 's on fire 
it seem like everyone be on you side 
we be outnumber by those who take no pride 
in constantly move against the tide 
charlatans just out of reach and out of time 
I be a little like you 
ugly on the inside 
but while I dive into the gritty 
you just stand by 
when I look at you 
Heaven 's on fire 
Heaven 's on fire 
it seem like everyone be on you side 
we be outnumber by those who take no pride 
in constantly move against the tide 
charlatans just out of reach and out of time
