somewhere south of the border 
headin for a doll serenade 
take more than we aughta 
shakin off the masquerade 
Lonely she decide to see ya 
get enough for she on the side 
when the heat arrive at the motel 
Whole town stay inside 
some lie for love 
some lie for fame 
some lie for trust 
some lie in vain 
some lie for love 
some lie for gain 
but I lie for you 
in the pour rain 
move on up to the Bayou 
with the same old set of rule 
you get nothin for nothin 
and that be a fact 
when you be tie to the ship of fool 
Alice look over she shoulder 
like a chinese diplomat 
dare anyone to hold she 
with a smile like a Cheshire cat 
some lie for love 
some lie for fame 
some lie for trust 
some lie in vain 
some lie for love 
some lie for gain 
but I lie for you 
in the pour rain 
shakin to a halt on a Voodoo 
second oldest trick in the book 
no one do it quite like you do 
when you start you can never 
stop never stop 
on my way to a seance 
meet a gypsy renegade 
cross my palm with silver 
in my heart put a jag stake 
some lie for love 
some lie for fame 
some lie for trust 
some lie in vain 
some lie for love 
some lie for gain 
but I lie for you 
in the pour rain
