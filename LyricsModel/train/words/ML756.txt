if none of we believe in war 
then can you tell I what the weapon be for 
listen to I everyone 
if the button be push there will be nowhere to run 
Giants sleeping giant 
win war within they dream 
until they wake when it be too late 
and in God 's name blaspheme

Mountains of madness stand so tall 
Marches of protest not stop the war 
or the killer of giant

Mountains of madness stand so tall 
rising so proudly it have nowhere to fall

Mountains of madness stand so tall 
Marches of protest not stop the war 
or the killer of giant
