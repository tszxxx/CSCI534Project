[Verse 1]
I curse to Hell the magistrate
Who granted this unholy fate
But I know
I know I asked for this myself
I’m bound by law to Hell
And it’s sick, sick, sick
Humans have their needs
Living in a fairytale, it’s tearing at the seams
The dank reject, the devil in a dress
Exactly what you see
[Bridge]
Sick, sick, sick
It’s sick, sick, sick
[Hook]
You made a mess of things
My, what a mess you’ve made
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me
In your world, it’s cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel sick, sick, sick
Oh woah, oh, oh, oh [x2]
[Verse 2]
If memory serves me correct
I gave you all, you gave me less
Your sexcapades deliver checks
But can’t afford you self-respect
And it’s sick, sick, sick
Humans on their knees
Living in a fairytale, it’s tearing at the seams
The dank reject, the devil in a dress
Exactly what you see
[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Maybe love is looking for someone to fill up holes
We grow up building lies with holes in all our walls
The watch can fall but here you were
With spare bricks to save the day
And we pray it’s not too late
Spare bricks can be dead weight
[Bridge x2]
[Hook]
