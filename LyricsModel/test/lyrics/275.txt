Teeny Bopper, my teenage lover
I caught your waves last night
It sent my mind to wonderin'
You're such a groove
Please don't move
Please stay in my love house by the river
Fast talkin' guys with strange red eyes
Have put things in your head
And started your mind to wonderin'
I love you so, please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino
Mendocino, Mendocino
Where life's such a groove
You blow your mind in the morning
We used to walk through the park
Make love along the way in Mendocino
(Ah, play it, Augie! Yeah!)
Hey!
Like I told you, Can you dig it?
If you wanna groove, I'll be glad to have you
'Cause I love you so, please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino
Mendocino, Mendocino
Where life's such a groove
You blow your mind in the morning
We used to walk through the park
Make love along the way in Mendocino
Mendocino, Mendocino, Mendocino
