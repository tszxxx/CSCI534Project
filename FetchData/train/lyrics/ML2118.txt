[Verse 1]
I don't know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How it used to be
Is it you or is it me
Look in the mirror
We are a fading memory
[Pre-Chorus]
Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold
[Chorus]
I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take the pain away
[Verse 2]
Fatal chaos
Hurtful lies
A broken dream
Is all we left behind
Is it you or is it me
Look in the mirror
Just a fading memory
[Pre-Chorus]
Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold
[Chorus]
I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take the pain away
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge, whispered]
I will live again, you'll see (Live again, and free)
Tomorrow's not scaring me (Not scaring me)
Far away from yesterday (So far away)
[Chorus]
I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take the pain away
