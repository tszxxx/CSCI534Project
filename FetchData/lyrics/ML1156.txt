Stay with me
Just a little
Lay with me
Just a little
Stay with me
Just a little more
YOU ARE LOVE
YOU ARE SOUL
YOU ARE REAL TO ME
Some might say my love devours you whole
Some might say that life is my love
Fools like us remind me trust
The way I feel surround you up
Some might say my love is reaching you
Some might say that life is waiting…
Alone
YOU ARE LOVE
YOU ARE SOUL
YOU ARE TEARS
YOU I KNOW
And I could love you
I could love you home
And all I ask for is that I love you
That I love you more
I would say empty things have empty dreams that find me
Some might say my love devours you whole
Some might say that life is my love
Fools like us remind me trust
The ways I feel surround you up
And I could love you, I could love you home
In ways I feel surround you
YOU ARE LOVE
YOU ARE REAL
YOU ARE SOUL
YOU I FEEL
Stay with me just a little more…
Cause fools like us remind me trust
The ways I feel LOVE
Do I feel love?
