I sit around and watch the tube but nothin be on 
I change the channel for a hour or two 
twiddle my thumb just for a bit 
I be sick of all the same old shit 
in a house with unlocked door 
and I be fuckin lazy 
bite my lip and close my eye 
take I away to paradise 
I be so damn bored I be go blind 
and I smell like shit 
peel I off this velcro seat and get I move 
I sure as hell can not do it by myself 
I be feel like a dog in heat 
barr indoors from the summer street 
I lock the door to my own cell 
and I lose the key 
bite my lip and close my eye 
take I away to paradise 
I be so damn bored I be go blind 
and I smell like shit 
I get no motivation 
where be my motivation 
no time for motivation 
smoke my inspiration 
I sit around and watch the phone but no one be call 
call I pathetic call I what you will 

we will 

my mother say to get a job 
but she do not like the one she be get 
when masturbation be lose it be fun 
you be fuck lonely 
bite my lip and close my eye 
take I away to paradise 
I be so damn bored I be go blind 
and loneliness have to suffice 
bite my lip and close my eye 
I be trip away to paradise 
some say quit or I will go blind 
but it be just a myth
