It's just like heaven
Being here with you
You're like an Angel
Too good to be true
But after all
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel Baby
When you are near me
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet
Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel baby
Whoo who, I love you
Whoo, I do
No one could love you
Like, I do
Wooo Whooo whoo whoo whoo
Woo Whooo Whoo
Please never leave me
Blue and alone
If you ever go
I'm sure you'll come back home
Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My Angel baby
It's just like heaven
Being with you, dear
I could never stay
Away without you near
Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel baby
Wooohoo I love you
Whooohoo I do
No one could love you
Like I do
Woooo whooo whooo
Woooooo whoo whoo
