I never think that this day would ever come when you word and you touch just strike I numb oh , and it 's plain to see that it 's dead the thing swim in blood and it 's cold , stony dead it 's so hard not to feel ashamed of the loving , live game we play each day and I be stuck in a shack down the back of the sea oh , and I be alive and I be alone inside a sick , sick dream oh , be it I , be it I that feel so weak ? I can not deceive but I find it hard to speak the hardest walk you could ever take be the walk you take from a to B to C I walk , oh honey , I talk do not want you to want I do not want you to need I do not want you to need I do not want you to need I and I walk
