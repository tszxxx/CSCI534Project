like a comet blaz across the evening sky go too soon like a rainbow Fading in the twinkle of a eye go too soon shiny and sparkly and splendidly bright here one day go one night like the loss of sunlight on a cloudy afternoon go too soon like a castle Built upon a sandy beach go too soon like a perfect flower that be just beyond you reach go too soon bear to amuse to inspire , to delight here one day go one night like a sunset dy with the rise of the moon go too soon go too soon
