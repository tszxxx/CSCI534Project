when I be dow and 
oh so much joy 
when I lose my way you love come smile on I 
I see you face and then I know 
we would be friend 
I be so afraid but you eye they would say come to I 
so I would say to you

when you love I I smile 
I feel you heart and you feel mine

do not go too far away 
if I can not see you face I will remember you smile 
but can this be right
