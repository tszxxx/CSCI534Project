you sorry eye cut through the bone 
they make it hard to leave you alone 
leave you here wear you wound 
wave you gun at somebody new 
baby you be a lose 
baby you be a lose 
baby you be a lose cause 
there be too many people you use to know 
they see you come they see you go 
they know you secret and you know theirs 
this town be crazy nobody care 
baby you be a lose 
baby you be a lose 
baby you be a lose cause 
I be tired of fight 
I be tired of fight 
fight for a lose cause 
there be a place where you be go 
you be not never be before 
no one leave to watch you back now 
no one stand at you door 
that be what you think love be for 
baby you be a lose 
baby you be a lose 
baby you be a lose cause 
I be tired of fight 
I be tired of fight 
fight for a lose cause
