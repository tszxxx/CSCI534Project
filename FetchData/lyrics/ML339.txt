[Verse 1]
I remember when you said your father's asleep
I remember swimming as our clothes drifted off to sea
[Pre-Chorus]
So wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
Wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
[Chorus]
Here we go
Just lose control and let your body give in
To the beat
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin
Is this love
Or just sexual desire?
We're gonna start a fire
[Verse 2]
I remember drinking as the stars were falling
I remember dancing on the hotel's unmade bed
[Pre-Chorus]
So wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
Wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
[Chorus]
Here we go
Just lose control and let your body give in
To the beat
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin
Is this love
Or just sexual desire?
We're gonna start a fire
Here we go
Just lose control and let your body give in
To the beat
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin
Is this love
Or just sexual desire?
We're gonna start a fire
[Bridge]
Taking chances in the back of your car
We burn and on the radio is "Rockin' in a Free World"
S.O.S., so obsessed
Oh you make me such a mess
Why can't this just last forever, why, why, why?
[Pre-Chorus]
So wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
[Chorus]
Here we go
Just lose control and let your body give in
To the beat
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin
Is this love
Or just sexual desire?
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
Here we go
Just lose control and let your body give in
To the beat
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin
Is this love
Or just sexual desire?
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
Just sexual desire
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
We're gonna start a fire
