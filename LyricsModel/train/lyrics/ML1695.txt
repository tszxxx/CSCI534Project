[Intro]
Hi
[Verse 1]
Scars will heal, soon
The dregs in us spent the earth down
[Verse 2]
Better than drowning in a burlap sack
I live, as Alice, I die
Children shouldn't play with dead things
Foaming crows
 
tear at their wings
Sad eyes cry crimson blood
[Verse 3]
Drop it, it's dead
Wheels won't turn, they won't turn the birdy's head
Sad eyes, sad eyes like sharpened daggers
You'll never walk, only stagger
Sad eyes, quite cryptic
Bye
