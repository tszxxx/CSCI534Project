habit alone when separate I moan 
feed on bone or anything grow 
I command post and nobody show 
in morning I rest here 
in evening I work here 
my debt be not spend till the rest of I 's left 
all I adore 
you must be the call 
the evil at night 
speak word of grace 
while spellwork delight 
feel my desire it burn like a fire 
feel my desire it burn like a fire 
I work alone save my soul 
if yesterday hurt tomorrow be worse 
send I a sign for my body 's align 
I be ready to waste all my limb and my face 
my pore be wide open 
and bleed for you potion 
spellwork and lie 
you must be the call 
the evil at night 
speak word of grace 
while spellwork delight 
feel my desire it burn like a fire 
feel my desire it burn like a fire 
you must be the call 
the evil at night 
speak word of grace 
while spellwork delight 
feel my desire it burn like a fire 
feel my desire it burn like a fire
