[Verse 1]
I've been a lot of places
My feet have kissed this land
I try real hard to remember all the faces
None seem to have what yours demands
[Verse 2]
I took a train to Chicago
Thought I could clear my mind
I took a plane out to find some truth
But all I found I can't seem to leave behind
[Chorus]
I dream of Chicago
I dream of our youth
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you
[Verse 3]
I'm sure I used to love you
And I'm sure you made me such a fool
But you were silent with your heart and affections
Tell me, girl, what's a boy supposed to do?
[Chorus]
I dream of Chicago
I dream of our youth
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you
I dream of Chicago
I dream of our youth
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you
I dream of Chicago (I dream of our youth)
I dream of our youth (of you)
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you
I dream of Chicago
I dream of our youth
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you
[Outro]
That I never said to you
