it be a matter of time 
it be a matter of luck 
it be a factor of chance 
'til I self destruct 
you fire at random 
I be under attack 
strap in and freewheeling 
Flying off the track 
I want to be you time bomb 
let I be you time bomb baby 
I want to be you time bomb 
please let I be you time bomb baby 
everywhere there be danger 
absolutely for real 
subliminal feeling 
too strong to conceal 
unscramble you program 
my turn to unload 
unbelievably certain 
guarantee to explode
