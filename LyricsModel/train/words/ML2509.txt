I fall to piece 
each time I see you again 
I fall to piece 
how can I be just you friend 
you want I to act like we have never kiss 
you want I to forget pretend we have never meet 
and I have try and I have try but I have not yet 
you walk by and I fall to piece 
I fall to piece 
each time someone speak you name 
I fall to piece 
time only add to the flame 
you tell I to find someone else to love 
someone who will love I too the way you use to do 
but each time I go out with someone new 
you walk by and I fall to piece
