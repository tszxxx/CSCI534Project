ooooh mama mama mama 
why you do not like my man 
ooooh mama mama mama 
why can not you understand

he do not always act right 
but when we be all alone 
do not you know he treat I right 
now love he could be so easy 
love he could be so easy 
but mama do not like my man 
no she do not like my man 
do not like the way he dress 
or the cigarette he smoke 
do not like the company he keep 
or the color of he joke

he say he be rough and he be lazy 
how can I explain 
how the way he drive I crazy 
but love he could be so easy 
love he could be so easy 
but mama do not like my man

why can not you understand 
love he could be so easy 
love he could be so easy 
but mama do not like my man 
no she do not like my man
