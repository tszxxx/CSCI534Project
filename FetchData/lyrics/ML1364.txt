I guess we've had our fun
But it seems our fun is over now
And that's all right
It's all right
Time for me to move along
And after all is said and done
I'll be all right
And it's all right
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault
And I know
I deserve to be alone
Cause everything's my fault
Here we go again unsuccessful to make amends
And that's all right
And it's all right
I've tried as hard as I can but I can't seem to understand
And that's all right
And it's all right
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault
And I know
I deserve to be alone
Cause everything's my fault
I guess it's over now your honesty has all run out
But that's all right
And it's all right
I just can't seem to see how the hell you can make believe
That it's all right
It's all right
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault
And I know
I deserve to be alone
Cause everything's my fault
Cause everything's my fault
Cause everything's my fault
Cause everything's my fault
Everything's my fault
