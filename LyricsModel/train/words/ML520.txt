it be be a long year 
since you have be go 
I have be alone here 
I have grow old 
I fall to piece I be fall 
fall to piece and I be still fall 
every time I be fall down 
all alone I fall to piece 
I keep a journal of memory 
I be feel lonely I can not breathe 
I fall to piece I be fall 
fall to piece and I be still fall 
all the year I have try 
with more to go 
will the memory die 
I be wait 
will I find you 
can I find you 
we be fall down 
I be fall 
every time I be fall down 
all alone I fall to piece 
every time I be fall down 
all alone I fall to piece 
every time I be fall down 
all alone I fall to piece 
every time I be fall down 
all alone I fall to piece
