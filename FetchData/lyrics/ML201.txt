[Verse 1: Jason Mraz]
Do you hear me, I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby, I'm trying
[Verse 2: Colbie Caillat]
Boy, I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard
[Chorus: Jason Mraz &amp; Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
[Verse 3: Jason Mraz &amp; Colbie Caillat]
They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will
[
Chorus
: Jason Mraz &amp; Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
[Verse 5: Colbie Caillat]
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now
[Chorus: Jason Mraz &amp; Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
[Outro: Jason Mraz &amp; Colbie Caillat]
Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
