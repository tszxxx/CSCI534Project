The sun is out
Spinning on its axis
Lead white vapor in the clouds
The pavement sucks right through the grates
The pavement sucks right through the ground
Don't go to Harvard
Don't go to Yale
Your disposition
Will only make you fail
You got a brain trust
You got a bloodlust
The grey area fucks with your sight
Sun up, sun up
The sun is sinking
Sun up, sun up
The sun is down
Sun up, sun up
The sun is sinking
Sun up, sun up
The sun is out
