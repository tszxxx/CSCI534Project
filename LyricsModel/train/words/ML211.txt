what I believe be all that I be 
take it away I be only a man 
back from the dead and now it appear 
I will be the one to take back the fear 
kill or be kill that be not I 
maybe it be you die to be 
somebody else man of the year 
but I be the one to take back the fear 
do not want anything take away 
take away from I 
it be all that I believe 
message of hate fade away 
my love and my failure one in the same 
now that I be back painfully clear 
but I will be the one to take back the fear 
when it seem that everything be all a dream 
everything be not what it seem 
even I can not believe in I easily
