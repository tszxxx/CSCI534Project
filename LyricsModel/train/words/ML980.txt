we be conduit of love 
live like phosphoresence 
half asleep and self indulge 
we have lose we essence 
can not you see 
we fall rain black from the star above 
when will we 
take a axe to the frozen season 
we be epitomy of flesh and blood 
we be luminescent 
half aware and self involved 
we have lose we essence 
can not you see 
we fall rain black from the star above 
when will we 
take a axe to the frozen season
