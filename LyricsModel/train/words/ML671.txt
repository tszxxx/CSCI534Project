tonight it be very clear 
cause we be both lie here 
there be so many thing I want to say 
I will always love you 
I would never leave you alone 
sometimes I just forget 
say thing I might regret 
it break my heart to see you cry 
I do not want to lose you 
I could never make it alone 
I be a man who will fight for you honor 
I will be the hero you be dream of 
we will live forever 
know together 
that we do it all for the glory of love 
you keep I stand tall 
you help I through it all 
I be always strong when you be beside I 
I have always need you 
I could never make it alone 
I be the man who will fight for you honor 
I will be the hero you have be dream of 
we will live forever 
know together 
that we do it all for the glory of love 
it be like a knight in shine armor 
from a long time ago 
just in time I will save the day 
take you to my castle far away 
I be the man who will fight for you honor 
I will be the hero that you dreaming of 
we be go to live for ever 
know together 
that we do it all for the glory of love 
we will live forever 
know together
