[Spoken: Woman]
Last night, I was so depressed
And I went and got the Bible
And I turned to the book of Revelations
And if people would just get and read the Bible
And read the book of Revelations
They would really turn around and straighten up
This is all we need to do, is just get the good book
And read it and put it to everyday life
[Spoken: Curtis Mayfield]
Sisters
Niggers
Whiteys
Jews
Crackers
Don't worry
If there's hell below
We're all
Gonna go
[Vocal]
Sisters
Brothers and the whiteys
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors
Hurry
People running from their worries
While the judge and his juries
Dictate the law that's partly flaw
Cat calling
Love balling, fussing and a-cussing
Top billing now is killing
For peace, no one is willing
Kind of make you get that feeling
Everybody smoke
Use the pill and the dope
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool
And Nixon talking 'bout, "Don't worry"
He say, "Don't worry"
He say, "Don't worry"
He say, "Don't worry"
But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's hell below
We're all gonna go
Everybody praying
And everybody saying
But when come time to do
Everybody's laying
Just talking 'bout, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
Sisters
Brothers and the whiteys
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors
Smoke
The pill and the dope
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool
And everybody's saying, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's hell below
We're all gonna go
Lord, what we gonna do?
Tell me what we gonna do?
If everything I say is true
This ain't no way it ought to be
If only all the mass could see
But they keep talking 'bout, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
They say, "Don't worry"
