here I be again in this mean old town 
and you be so far away from I 
and where be you when the sun go down 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far I just can not see 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far away from I alright 
I be tired of be in love and be all alone 
when you be so far away from I 
I be tired of make out on the telephone 
cause you be so far away from I 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far I just can not see 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far away from I alright 
and I get so tired when I have to explain 
that you be so far away from I 
see you have be in the sun and I have be in the rain 
and you be so far away from I 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far I just can not see 
you be so far away from I 
you be so far away from I take it dow and 
so far away 
you be so far away from I 
alright 
I be so far away from you
