remember love note the teacher find in school 
the whole class laugh gee I feel just like a fool 
but that be not the very part about I 
I have to write 1 thousand time 
that I love you I love you 
I love you I love you 
girl I love you 1 thousand time 
the love note I treasure love you be not a sin 
punishment be pleasure whoo I would do it all over again 
I write and I write till my finger get sore 
but I have to write just a little bit more 
do you read my letter it be be on my mind 
all that it say be girl I love you one thousand time 
from they until this very same day 
I still feel that same old way
