[Verse 1]
I get all numb
When she sings that "It's over"
Such a strange numb
And it brings my knees to the earth
[Chorus]
And God bless you all
For the song you sang us
[Verse 2]
You're the same numb
When you sing "It's over"
Such a strange numb
It could bring back peace to the Earth
[Chorus]
So God bless you all
For the song you sang us all
For the hearts you break
Every time you moan
[Bridge]
I get all numb
We're the same numb
And it brings our knees to the earth
[Chorus]
So God bless you all
For the song you sang us all
For the hearts you break
Every time you moan
[Outro]
And God bless you all
On the Earth
