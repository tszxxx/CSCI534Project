the human confrontation I have build a phobia 
it take my essence somewhere 
somewhere to take control 
I may be far from rocking 
I be the one alone 
I may be far behind line 
and make they turn away 
I want to know hey you watch out 
I have make they turn to cripple hey you watch out 
when i will know who will know back fight 
why time would let I die to control 
I fear nothing why do not you know 
I rip my mind and why do not you bleed 
I fear no one why you turn back 
I may not stop 
my freedom can not contain but tell I 
the pain I liberate 
riff hostility to anyone 
have make we so much hate 
I make they turn from hate but tell I 
the pain and suffering 
I make they turn from hate but tell I 
the pain and suffering 
I know
