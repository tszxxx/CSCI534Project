face to face 
no time to waste 
this be the time for revenge 
you claim to fame 
of crush dream 
you control have no hold on I 
I hate the way 
you have no shame 
you act like nothing be happen 
it be time to rise 
the final fight 
this be the last time 
I will not fail again 
I will not let you win 
fuck you power trip 
I will throw away 
the waste day 
the chance for revenge 
my claim of fame 
end in vain 
this be the last time 
you be the one who be forsaken it all 
nothing have change so together 
we fall 
I be the one who be lead we to believe 
you can not change I
