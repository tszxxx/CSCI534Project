[Verse 1]
Time on your side that will never end
The most beautiful thing you could ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic
[Bridge]
It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
[Verse 1]
Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Suck more blood than a back-street dentist
[Bridge]
It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
[Chorus]
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
[Verse 2]
Great ruins make for a greater glory
The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down I'll get right back up again
I come back stronger than a powered-up Pac Man
[Bridge]
It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
[Chorus]
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home...
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from...
