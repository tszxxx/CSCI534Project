London 's burnin'! London 's burnin'! all across the town , all across the night everybody 's drivin ' with full headlight Black or white ya ' turn it on , ya ' face the new religion everybody 's sittin ' ' round watch television ! London 's burnin ' with boredom now London 's burn dial 99999 London 's burnin ' with boredom now London 's burnin ' dial 99999 I be up and down the Westway , in and out the light what a great traffic system , it 's so bright I can not think of a better way to spend the night than speedin ' around underneath the yellow light now I be in the subway and I be lookin ' for the flat this one lead to this block , this one lead to that the wind howl through the empty block look for a home I run through the empty stone because I be all alone London 's burnin'!
