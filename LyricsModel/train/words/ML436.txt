down at the Astoria the scene be change 
bingo and rock be push out X-rating 
we be the first band to vomit in the bar 
and find the distance to the stage too far 
meanwhile it be get late at ten o'clock 
rock be dead they say 
long live rock 
long live rock I need it every night 
long live rock come on and join the line 
long live rock be it dead or alive 
people walk in sideway pretend that they be leave 
we put on we makeup and work out all the lead in 
Jack be in the alley sell ticket make in Hong Kong 
promoter be in the pay box wonder where the band be go 
back in the pub the governor stop the clock 
rock be dead they say 
long live rock 
landslide rock be fall 
fall down around we very head 
we try but you be yawn 
look again rock be dead rock be dead rock be dead 
the place be really jump to the 
Hiwatt amp 
until a 20 inch cymbal fall and cut the lamp 
in the blackout they dance right into the aisle 
and as the door fly open even the promoter smile 
someone take he pants off and the rafter knock 
rock be dead they say 
long live rock long live rock long live rock 
long live rock long live rock long live rock 
long live rock long live rock long live rock 
long live rock I need it every night 
long live rock come on and join the line 
long live rock be it dead or alive
