I be in the mood for love simply because you be near I funny , but when you be near I I be in the mood for love Heaven be in you eye Bright as the star we be under oh , be it any wonder ? oh baby baby , I be in the mood for love why stop to think of whether this little dream might fade we put we heart together now we be one , I be not afraid if there 's a cloud above if it should rain , we will let it oh , just for tonight , forget it Baby I be in the mood for love
