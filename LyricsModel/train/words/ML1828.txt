Fire fire fire 
Orange yellow and black flesh tree bloom fire fire fire 
I be trap inside this motel 6 on fire fire fire 
those young fist clench in the air 
make a million millionaire 
set fire to the ship on fire 
set fire to the hip on fire 
constellation string up like barb wire wire wire 
I be drink cement like it be go out of style style style 
those cold hook cemetery claw 
rake out the infant 's jaw 
set fire to the horse on fire 
set fire to the dress on fire 
set fire to the stage on fire 
set fire to the star on fire 
now i be tie to a seagull 's back yeah fire fire fire 
and all those black hair bandit try to lure I down with they song and choir choir choir 
I would rather shoot up a syringe fill with fire fire fire 
than go to bed with sound so vacant and tired tired tired 
what be the sound of a cashing check 
what be the sound of a gag reflex 
like speaker crush beneath a empty tank 
blow the ugly off a airbrush face 
set fire to the drum on fire 
set fire to the lion on fire 
set fire to the house on fire 
set fire to the face on fire
