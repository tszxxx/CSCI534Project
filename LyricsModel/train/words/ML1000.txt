well , someone tell I yesterday that when you throw you love away you act as if you just do not care you look as if you be go somewhere but I just can not convince myself I could not live with no one else and I can only play that part and sit and nurse my break heart so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely now no - one 's knock upon my door for a thousand year , or more all make up and nowhere to go welcome to this one man show just take a seat , they be always free no surprise , no mystery in this theatre that I call my soul I always play the starr role so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely so lonely I feel lonely , I be so lonely , I feel so low
