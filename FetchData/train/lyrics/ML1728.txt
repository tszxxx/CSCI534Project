[Chorus]
I’m in love, yes i am
I’m in love, yes i am, uh
I’m in love, hey baby, hey, you know i am
I’m in love, uh, huh, you know i am
[Verse 1]
Friends all wonder what’s come over me
I’m as happy as any girl could be
[Chorus]
(Love, love, love) i’m in love
(Love, love, love) believe me i am
(Love, love, love) i’m in love, oh
(Love, love, love) yes sir i am, yes sir i am, yes sir i am
(Love, love, love) hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Love, love, love) i’m in love
[Verse 2]
And i’m so glad that it’s me who had to change
I’m sprouting and blooming like the last summer rose
[Chorus]
(Love, love, love) i’m in love
(Love, love, love) i’m in love, i’m in love, i’m in love, i’m in love
(Love, love, love) i’m in love, i’m in
(Love, love, love)
[Outro]
I’m in love
(Love, in love, in love)
In the morning
(In love, in love, in love, in love)
I wake up smiling and shining
(Love, in love, in love) i’m in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)
Smiling like love i know where it’s at
(Love, in love, in love) i’m in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)
I’m in love
(Love, in love, in love) i’m in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love) yes i am
(Love, in love, in love) um, i’m in love
