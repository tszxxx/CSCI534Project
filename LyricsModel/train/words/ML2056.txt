hope dangle on a string 
like slow spinning redemption 
wind in and wind out 
the shine of it have catch my eye 
and rope I in so mesmerizing 
so hypnotize 
I be captivate 
I be 
vindicate I be selfish I be wrong 
I be right I swear I be right 
swear I know it all along 
and I be flawed 
but I be clean up so well 
I be see in I now 
the thing you swear you see yourself 
so clear like the diamond in you ring 
cut to mirror you intention 
oversized and overwhelmed 
the shine of which have catch my eye 
and render I so isolate 
so motivated 
I be certain now that 
I be 
vindicate I be selfish I be wrong 
I be right I swear I be right 
swear I know it all along 
and I be flawed 
but I be clean up so well 
I be see in I now 
the thing you swear you see yourself 
so turn up the corner of you lip 
part they and feel my fingertip 
trace the moment fall forever 
Defense be paper thin 
just one touch and I would be in 
too deep now to ever swim against the current 
so let I slip away 
so let I slip away 
so let I slip away 
so let I slip against the current 
so let I slip away 
so let I slip away 
so let I slip away 
so let I slip away 
vindicate I be selfish I be wrong 
I be right I swear I be right 
swear I know it all along 
and I be flawed 
but I be clean up so well 
I be see in I now 
the thing you swear you see yourself 
like hope dangle on a string 
like slow spinning redemption
