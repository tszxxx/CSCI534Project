you have get to give a little take a little 
and let you poor heart break a little 
that be the story of that be the glory of love 
you have get to laugh a little cry a little 
before the cloud roll by a little 
that be the story of that be the glory of love 
as long as there be the two of we 
we have get the world and all it 's charm 
and when the world be through with we 
we have get each other 's arm 
you have get to win a little lose a little 
and always have the blue a little 
that be the story of that be the glory of love 
and when the world be through with we 
we have get each other 's arm 
you have get to win a little lose a little 
and always have the blue a little 
that be the story of that be the glory of love 
that be the story of that be the glory of love
