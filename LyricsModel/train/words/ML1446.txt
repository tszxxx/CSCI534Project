the summer day be go too soon 
you shoot the moon 
and miss completely 
and now you be leave to face the gloom 
the empty room that once smell sweetly 
of all the flower you pluck if only 
you know the reason 
why you have to each be lonely 
be it just the season 
and now the fall be here again 
you can not begin to give in 
it be all over 
when the snow come roll through 
you be roll too with some new lover 
will you think of time you tell I 
that you know the reason 
why we have to each be lonely 
it be just the season 
will you think of time you tell I 
that you know the reason 
why we have to each be lonely 
it be just the season
