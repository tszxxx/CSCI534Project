[Verse 1]
When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time
[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?
[Verse 2]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found
[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?
[Verse 2]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
[Outro]
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
