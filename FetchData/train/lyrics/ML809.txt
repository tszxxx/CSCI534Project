Well ya can't sit still
File:Gliss Morning Light
Nobody asked you to
When you close your eyes
Darling does it look so fine
In the morning light
Can't even see your face
In the morning light
I can't even see your face
In your heart
In your heart
It's a start
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart
Darlin' it's a start
Darlin' in your heart
Sitting next to me
Nobody could sympathize
Only in my dreams
Everything comes to life
In your heart
In your heart
It's a start
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart
Darlin' it's a start
Darlin' in your heart
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh... ahhhhhh
In your heart
In your heart
Darlin' it's a start
Darlin' in your heart
