whenever I be alone with you 
you make I feel like I be home again 
whenever I be alone with you 
you make I feel like I be whole again 
whenever I be alone with you 
you make I feel like I be young again 
whenever I be alone with you 
you make I feel like I be fun again 
however far away I will always love you 
however long I stay I will always love you 
whatever word I say I will always love you 
I will always love you 
whenever I be alone with you 
you make I feel like I be free again 
whenever I be alone with you 
you make I feel like I be clean again 
however far away I will always love you 
however long I stay I will always love you 
whatever word I say I will always love you 
I will always love you
