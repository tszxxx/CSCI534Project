evil runnin through we brain 
we and evil be about the same 
bad blood through we body flow 
where be the love nobody know 
beauty in we face you see 
tryin to hide all we misery 
but evil runnin through we brain 
we and evil be about the same oh yeah 
evil in we life 
evil causin strife yeah yeah 
lookin for a place to guide 
a little light in we soul and mind oh yeah 
maybe if we learn to pray 
life would give we sunshiny day 
and evil it be runnin through we brain 
turn to love and will not be the blame 
evil in we life 
evil causin strife
