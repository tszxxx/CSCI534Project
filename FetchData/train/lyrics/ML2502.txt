It's been so long since I've had a smile
I've been down for such a long while
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
You kiss me now and I'll turn away
I think I'm still kissing yesterday
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up
Don't want to spend the rest of my days in yesterday's daydream
Out with the bad and in with the good
I feel my heart, girl you're knocking on wood
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So generous, I'm being kind
With selfishness in the back of my mind
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one that can make me happy
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one that can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up
Don't want to spend the rest of my days in yesterdays daydreams
Don't want to spend the rest of my days deep in yesterdays promises
It's been so long since I've had a smile
I stayed sad for such a long while
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
No more giving my mind away
Tomorrow's love, done with yesterday
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up
Don't want to spend the rest of my days in yesterday's daydreams
Don't want to spend the rest of my days deep in yesterday's promises
Don't want to spend the rest of my days singing yesterday's love songs
