hardly wait til the bed be warm 
you close you eye and say I be feel tear 
how could I be so unendingly force into this course 
sad I feel sad 
for you so sad 
you will be leave alone and break bleed 
from the heart when he do not come home 
Softly sigh my nightingale 
another broken promise tip the scale and it go pale 
he sing shift from side to side 
can not make up he god give mind no 
why do not you just go 
if she be wait 
whoa oh honey I be tell you you better think about it
