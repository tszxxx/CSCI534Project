what be leave for we to say between hello and goodbye 
any day now you will close the door and walk away 
I will be pick through the piece and wonder how it come to this 
if thing do not go the way you want it 
well that be the way it go 
these photograph remind I 
of all the thing I say 
and the promise I make you 
on the day that we first meet 
but be not that just like you baby 
be not that just like you 
be not that like you 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be all over and the day go by 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be not be easy to slowly watch you go 
I wonder if you know just what you be doin to I 
know what we have be through before what be I say 
you have be act strangely lately so far away yet you be next to I 
when thing be not the way they should be 
get to know when to let it go 
these photograph remind I 
of all the thing I say 
and the promise I make you 
on the day that we first meet 
but be not that just like you baby 
be not that just like you 
be not that like you 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be all over and the day go by 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be not be easy to slowly watch you go 
you be do I wrong 
but I would have you back if it be mine to choose 
you be do I wrong 
but I would still have you back if it be mine to choose 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be all over and the day go by 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be not be easy to slowly watch you go 
use to be you sun in my sky 
till the cloud come over and the night set in 
use to be you sun in my sky 
it be not be easy to slowly watch you go oh no
