once upon a time a girl with moonlight in she eye put she hand in mine and say she love I so but that be once upon a time very long ago once upon a time we sit beneath a willow tree count all the star and wait for the dawn but that be once upon a time now the tree be go how the breeze ruffle up she hair how we always laugh as though tomorrow be not there we be young and do not have a care where do it go once upon a time the world be sweeter than we know everything be ours how happy we be then but somehow once upon a time never come again once upon a time never come again
