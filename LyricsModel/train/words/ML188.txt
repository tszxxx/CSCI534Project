the thrill be go 
the thrill be go away 
the thrill be go baby 
the thrill be go away 
you know you do I wrong baby 
and you will be sorry someday 
the thrill be go 
it be go away from I 
the thrill be go baby 
the thrill be go away from I 
although I will still live on 
but so lonely I will be 
the thrill be go 
it be go away for good 
oh the thrill be go baby 
it be go away for good 
someday I know I will be over it all baby 
just like I know a man should 
you know I be free free now baby 
I be free from you spell 
I be free free free now 
I be free from you spell 
and now that it be all over 
all I can do be wish you well
