Christmas future be far away Christmas past be past 
Christmas present be here today bring joy that may last 
have yourself a merry little Christmas may you heart be light 
in a year we trouble will be out of sight 
from now on have yourself a merry little Christmas make the yuletide gay 
in a year we trouble will be mile away 
here we be as in olden day happy golden day of yore 
precious friend who be dear to we gather near to we once more 
I know that in a year we all will be together if the Fates allow 
until then we will just have to muddle through somehow 
and have ourselves a merry little Christmas now 
cause everybody know
