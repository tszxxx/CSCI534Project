whoa oh whoa oh oh oh 
have I ever tell you 
how good it feel to hold you 
it be not easy to explain 
and though I be really try 
I think I may start cry 
my heart can not wait another day 
when you kiss I I have just get to say 
come on baby 
ooh ee baby 
baby I love only you 
whoa oh whoa oh oh oh 
I can not live without you 
I love everything about you 
I can not help it if I feel this way 
oh I be so glad I find you 
I want my arm around you 
I love to hear you call my name 
oh tell I that you feel the same 
come on baby 
ooh ee baby 
baby I love only you 
whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
