I do not know 
I can not see 
who we be now 
how it use to be 
be it you or be it I 
look in the mirror 
we be a fading memory 
where be we 
we get lose 
in the cold 
I will live again you will see 
tomorrow be not scare I 
far away from yesterday 
just take the pain away 
fatal chaos 
hurtful lie 
a broken dream 
be all we leave behind 
be it you or be it I 
look in the mirror 
just a fading memory 
where be we 
we get lose 
in the cold 
I will live again you will see 
tomorrow be not scare I 
far away from yesterday 
just take the pain away 
I will live again you will see 
tomorrow be not scare I 
far away from yesterday 
I will live again you will see 
tomorrow be not scare I 
far away from yesterday 
just take the pain away
