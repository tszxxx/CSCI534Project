corpse rot through the night in blood lace misery 
scorch earth the policy

the pendulum it shave the blade the strafing air blood raid 
infiltration push reserve encircle the front line 
supreme art of strategy play on the mind 
bombard till submission take all to they grave 
indication of triumph the number that be dead 
Sport the war

when victory be really massacre 
the final swing be not a drill

when victory be really survival 
the final swing be not a drill

Bones shine by the night in blood lace misery 
campaign of elimination twist psychology 
when victory be to survive and death be defeat 
Sport the war

the sport be war total war 
when the end be a slaughter 
the final swing be not a drill 
it be how many people I can kill
