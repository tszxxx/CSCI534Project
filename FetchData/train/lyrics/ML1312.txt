This tired city was somebody's dream
Billboard horizons as black as they seem
A four-level highway across the land
We're building a home for the family of man
Prices are rising, the devil's to pay
Moving the mountain that got in the way
Prayer books and meetings to find a plan
Deciding the fate of the family of man
So hard
Whatever are we coming to?
Yes, it's so hard
With so little time and so much to do
Memories replacing the loves that we lost
Burning our bridges as soon as they're crossed
Factories built where the rivers ran
Time's running out for the family of man
So hard
So hard
So hard
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man
