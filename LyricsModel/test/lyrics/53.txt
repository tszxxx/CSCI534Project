[Intro]
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
[Chorus 1]
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
[Chorus 2]
I wanna fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
'Til I'm free
Oh, Lord, through the revolution
[Verse]
Feed the babies
Who don't have enough to eat
Shoe the children
With no shoes on their feet
House the people
Livin' in the street
Oh, oh, there's a solution
[Chorus 2]
I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
'Til I'm free
Fly through the revolution
[Chorus 1]
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
[Chorus 1]
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
[Bridge]
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
[Chorus 2]
I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
'Til I'm free
Fly through the revolution
[Bridge]
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
(Tick tock tick)
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
(Tick tock tick) Doo doo doo-doo
[Chorus 1]
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
