one day while bathing in the sea 
my talking dolphin speak to I 
he speak to I in symphony 
from freedom 's peace beneath the sea 
he look to I eye full of love 
Said yes we live behind the sun 
behind the sun 
behind the sun 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
behind the sun 
the sun go up 
and the sun get down 
but like the heart of the sun 
my heart continue to pound 
behind the sun 
now while I shower in the rain 
I watch my dolphin swim away 
the one who listen to the surf 
can feel the pulse beat of the earth 
and like my dolphin swim so free 
the sun do swim into the sea 
behind the sun 
behind the sun 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
behind the sun 
behind the sun 
a island fly through the sky 
one day you son might ask you why 
and if you son should be a girl 
she too might ask you of this world 
the sun shine sweet upon you beach 
and yes my dolphin love to teach 
behind the sun 
behind the sun 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
behind the sun 
the sun go up 
and the sun get down 
but like the heart of the sun 
my heart continue to pound 
behind the sun
