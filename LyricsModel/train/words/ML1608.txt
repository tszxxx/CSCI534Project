some folk build like this some folk build like that 
but the way I be build do not you call I fat 
because I be build for comfort I be not build for speed 
but I get everything all that a good girl need 
some folk rip and roar some folk b'lieve in sign 
but if you want I baby you get to take you time 
because I be build for comfort I be not build for speed 
but I get everything all the good girl need 
and I be not get no diamond I be not get no gold 
but I do have love to satisfy you soul 
because I be build for comfort I be not build for speed 
but I get everything all you good woman need
