you know when you give you love away 
it open you heart everything be new 
and you know time will always find a way 
to let you heart believe it be true 
you know love be everything you say 
a whisper a word

you know this be the way love be 
Amarantine

Amarantine amarantine amarantine 
love be love be love 
you know love may sometimes make you cry 
so let the tear go they will flow away 
for you know love will always let you fly 
how far a heart can fly away 
Amarantine amarantine amarantine 
love be love be love 
Amarantine amarantine amarantine

Amarantine amarantine amarantine

you know when love be shine in you eye 
it may be the star fall from above 
and you know love be with you when you rise 
for night and day belong to love
