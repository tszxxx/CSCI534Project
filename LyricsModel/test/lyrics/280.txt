Yeah, haa haa, so, haa haa, wait on wait on
Up lazy river where the old mill run
Meet the lazy river with the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind ole tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me, dream a dream of me
Up the lazy river where the robin's sung
Wakes to bright new mornin', as we live along
Blue skies up above everyone in love
Up the lazy river, how happy we will be, mama mama?
Ohh, Up a lazy river
Ohh, you've gone
Boy, my river my long river
Up the lazy river, hmm river, ohh you river
Ohh, you've gone
Ohh you river
You got that John Alexander
Swing out there on your ma's river boy
