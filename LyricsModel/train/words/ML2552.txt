to live for today and to love for tomorrow 
be the wisdom of a fool 
because tomorrow be promise to no one 
you see love be that wonderful thing that the whole wide world need plenty of 
and if you think for one minute that you can live without it 
then you be only fool yourself 
listen please I would like to tell you something that happen to I just the other day 
I awaken this morning I be fill with despair 
all my dream turn to ashe and go oh yeah 
as I look at my life it be barren and bare 
without love I have have nothing at all 
without love I have have nothing 
without love I have have nothing at all 
I have conquer the world 
all but one thing do I have 
without love I have have nothing at all 
once I have a sweetheart who love only I 
there be nothing oh that she would not give oh no 
but I be blind to she goodness and I could not see 
that a heart without love can not live 
without love I have have nothing 
without love I have have nothing at all 
I have conquer the world 
all but one thing do I have 
without love I have have nothing at all
