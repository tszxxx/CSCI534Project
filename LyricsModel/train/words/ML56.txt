it be go before you ever have a chance 
lose forever in you disapproving glance 
I see you face it be twist with shock 
fall from grace you deserve what you get 
the ice surround you now 
you can pretend all that you want 
I have see the pain and all of the evil you bring 
quit you fuck crying and swallow all you pill 
you be not the only one with the urge to kill 
grab the dusty bottle and let the liquor spill 
devoid of life death be you final thrill 
bloodshot eye can see right through the selfish lie 
search forever for a fix that keep you high 
I see you face it be twist with shock 
fall from grace you deserve what you get 
my hand around you throat 
you can pretend all that you want 
I have see the pain and all of the evil you bring 
I be the king of nothing over emptiness I reign 
drow with sorrow wash away the pain 
I be the king of nothing over emptiness I reign 
drow with sorrow wash away the pain 
I see you face it be twist with shock 
fall from grace you deserve what you get 
my hand around you throat 
you can pretend all that you want 
I have see the pain and all of the evil you bring 
I be the king of nothing over emptiness I reign 
drow with sorrow wash away the pain 
I be the king of nothing over emptiness I reign 
drow with sorrow wash away the pain 
quit you fuck crying 
quit you fuck crying 
quit you fuck crying 
quit you fuck crying
