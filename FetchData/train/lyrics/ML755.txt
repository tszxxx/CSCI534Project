[Verse 1]
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt
[Chorus]
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
[Verse 2]
Yesterday I was dirty, wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt
Yesterday I was dirty, wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt
[Chorus]
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
[Bridge]
Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
[Interlude]
2005 Against All Gods Mix:
I don't know love, I never cared to and I'm not sure if I ever will
I'm a student of hate. I know now that god is a medium
Whatever I expected to save me from this life is no longer the one I can hate
It is the people that made me; it is the people I wanted so much to be
I may only find love in their destruction
Original Mix:
Na na-na na na
Na na-na na na
Na na-na na na
Na na-na na
[Chorus]
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies, we wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
