intro 
I be ridin in you car you turn on the radio 
you be pullin I close I just say no 
I say I do not like it but you know I be a liar 
cause when we kiss ooh fire 
late at night you be takin I home 
you say you want to stay I say I want to be alone 
I say I do not love you 
but you know I be a liar 
cause when we kiss ooh fire 
you have a hold on I right from the start 
a grip so tight I could not tear it apart 
my nerve all jumpin' actin like a fool 
well you kiss they burn but my heart stay cool 
pause 
well Romeo and Juliet Samson and Delilah 
baby you can bet a love they could not deny 
my word say split but my word they lie 
cause when we kiss ooh fire 
Bridge 
oh fire 
kiss like fire 
burn I up with fire 
I like what you be doin now fire 
touchin I fire 
touchin I burnin I fire 
take I home
