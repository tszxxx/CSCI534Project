[Verse 1]
She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of the greenest tree
She sends out an aroma of undefined love
It drips on down in a mist from above
[Chorus]
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
[Verse 2]
You hear her calling everywhere you turn
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn
But the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue
She's the real thing but you knew it all along
[Chorus]
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
[Post-Chorus]
Look at you with your mouth watering
Look at you with your mind spinning
Why don't we just admit it's all over
She's just the girl you want
[Chorus]
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, just the girl
The girl you want
[Verse 1]
She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of the greenest tree
She sends out an aroma of undefined lust
It drips on down in a mist from above
[Chorus]
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
[Post-Chorus]
Look at you with your mouth watering
Look at you with your mind spinning
Why don't we just admit it's all over
She's just the girl you want
[Chorus]
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
