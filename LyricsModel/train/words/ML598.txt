my name be Vernon James 
and I live to the south of town 
I work my window watch the woman 
go round and round 
some people come here for love 
some people come for fantasy 
when two in the morning come around 
my baby come around for I 
someone come come my someone 
take the cloud from my eye my one 
I know that sometime soon 
one day we will walk in the sun 
I be take ticket 
watch the man always look down 
sometimes I feel like a animal 
in the zoo stare out 
no one look I in the eye 
they save it for the girl inside 
I do not much care what they see 
I know she save it all for I 
someone come come my someone 
take the cloud from my eye my one 
I know that sometime soon 
one day we will walk in the sun 
some people come here for love 
some come for curiosity 
I know there will be a day 
I know we will figure out a way 
someone come come my someone 
take the cloud from my eye my one 
I know that sometime soon 
one day we will walk in the sun 
someone come come my someone 
take the cloud from my eye my one 
I know that sometime soon 
one day we will walk in the sun 
one day we will walk in the sun 
one day we will walk in the sun 
one day we will walk in the sun 
one day we will walk in the sun
