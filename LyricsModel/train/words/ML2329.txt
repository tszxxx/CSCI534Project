no use ignore I I represent the darkest thing you feel 
no use avoid I I be wave in the fabric of you being 
do not back away from I I feed on apprehension and fear 
do not back away from I do not blind yourself to what you really should be see 
a part of you that will consume if give the chance to 
a part of you that will abuse whenever allow to 
a part of you that will consume if give the chance to 
a part of you that want to see you loose it all 
c'mon see what you get 
c'mon when will you 
come to term with what be inside 
come to term with what you try to hide 
emotion overload might really mean the end of the road 
emotion overload might mean the end of everything you know 
emotional check just might reveal emotional wreck 
emotional check just might reveal you weakness 's cause you have finish
