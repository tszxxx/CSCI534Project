[Verse 1]
She's like a little bird
She flies from A to B
To see what she can see
She's far away from me
[Verse 2]
We danced on the moon
We danced by the sea
The land of blue gold
Is where we were free
[Chorus]
July-ly-ly
July-ly-ly
July-ly-ly
[Post-Chorus]
Where we were free
Where we were free
[Verse 3]
The shiny blackest crow
Flew in to say hello
Though much to her surprise
He had two mouths for eyes
[Verse 4]
She understood his words
That crow was very pleased
He gave to her his wings
And now she is free
[Chorus]
July-ly-ly
July-ly-ly
July-ly-ly
[Post-Chorus]
Now we are free
Now we are free
[Chorus]
July-ly-ly
July-ly-ly
July-ly-ly
[Non-Lyrical Outro]
