I do not mean to waste you time 
I just need someone to talk to 
if you do not mind 
then the thought of loneliness 
that tonight I guess I be just too weak to fight 
I can take the lonely day 
but I can not take these lonely night 
be you alone 
tell I what be you name 
I just need someone to lean on 
I be not play any game 
so sit down here beside I 
and let I buy you a glass of red rose wine 
I can take the lonely day 
but I can not take these lonely night 
well I think that I be strong 
but the night can be so long when you need a friend 
oh but maybe we could find a little piece of mind 
before the morning come again 
oh pardon I 
if it seem I be holdin on 
let go it just be not easy 
when you sleeping all alone 
let 's forget about tomorrow 
beg steal or borrow just a little time 
I can take the lonely day 
but I can not take these lonely night 
yes I can take the lonely day 
but I can not take these lonely night
