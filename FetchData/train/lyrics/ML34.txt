What you want
You are
You always were
What you want
You are
You always were
When the plans fall
Changing hands
What are the chances
Of winning?
You, you hold my heart
You, you won't let up
After when I'm caught
Touch turns into fisticuffs
It's all in your head
Wonder if I'm fixed to cut
Fake statistics
In the collected whole
With all the hunger
That keeps you climbing walls
It's the one thing you can count on
We all end floating away
We all end floating away
You, you hold my heart
You, you won't let up
After when I'm caught
Touch turns into fisticuffs
It's all in your head
Wonder if I'm fixed to cut
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
You
You're sinking, so they say
You
You're finished, so they say
You
You're buried, so they say
You
A killer killing fate
