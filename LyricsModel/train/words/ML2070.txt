time on you side that will never end 
the most beautiful thing you can ever spend 
but you work in a shirt with you name tag on it 
drift apart like a plate tectonic 
it do not matter to I 
cause all I want to be 
be a million mile from here 
somewhere more familiar 
too much time spend drag the past up 
I do not see you not look when I mess up 
settle down in you early twenty 
suck more blood than a backstreet dentist 
it do not matter to I 
cause all I want to be 
be a million mile from here 
somewhere more familiar 
oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
great ruler make for greater glory 
the only thing grow be we history 
knock I down I will get right back up again 
I will come back stronger than a power up Pac man 
it do not matter to I 
cause all I want to be 
be a million mile from here 
somewhere more familiar 
oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home 
and oh my god I can not believe it 
I have never be this far away from home
