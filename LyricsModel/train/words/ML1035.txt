Mercy do not think she be pretty no more 
Starin at the star through she back screen door 
she try and try to make it all work out 
no matter what she do 
she be leave standin in the middle of doubt 
in a lonely day 
and in the pourin rain 
you can count on I 
sometimes she cry 
when she be alone at night 
sometimes she weep 
when she be feelin cold and weak 
sometimes the pain 
it just tear she up inside 
sometimes she cry 
ooh I wonder why 
Mercy do not have a lover no more 
she play with she pillow 
stare at the bedroom floor 
use to have a million 
they have come and go 
no matter what she do 
she can not figure out what she be doin wrong 
in a lonely night 
and in the pourin rain 
you can count on I 
sometimes she cry 
when she be alone at night 
sometimes she weep 
when she be feelin cold and weak 
sometimes the pain 
oh it tear she up inside 
sometimes she cry 
ooh yeah 
livin lovin give everything you get 
after all the heartache 
maybe give love just one more shot away 
in a lonely night 
and in the pourin rain 
the only thing I really want to know be why 
sometimes she cry 
when she be alone at night 
sometimes she weep 
when she be feelin cold and weak 
sometimes the pain 
oh it tear she up inside 
sometimes she cry 
oooh yeah yeah yeah
