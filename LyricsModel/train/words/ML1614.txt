there be a light 
a certain kind of light 
that never show on I 
I want my life to be 
live with you 
live with you 
there be a way 
everybody say 
to do each and every little thing 
but what do it bring 
if I be not get you 
if I be not get you 
baby you do not know what it be like 
baby you do not know what it be like 
to love somebody 
to love somebody 
the way I love you 
in my mind 
I see you face again 
I know my frame of mind 
you be not get to be so blind 
but I be blind 
so very blind 
I be a man 
can not you see what I be 
I live and breathe and for you 
but what good do it do 
if I be not get you 
if I be not get you 
baby you do not know what it be like 
baby you do not know what it be like 
to love somebody 
to love somebody 
the way I love you
