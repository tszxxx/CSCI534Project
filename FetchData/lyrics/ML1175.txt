Can't understand
Why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
With the silly, silly games we play
We've got our love
And no matter how it's said or done
We are one no matter what we do
We are one our love will see us through
We are one and that's the way it is
We are one
Sometimes I feel
That we try and make each other sad
I don't know why
The things we do
How we make each other feel so bad
We've got so much
We could all be having so much fun
We are one from the very start
We are one deep down in your heart
We are one
And that's the way it is
We are one
I can't understand
Why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
With the silly silly games we play, play
We've got our love, our love
And no matter how it's said or done
We are one
We are one
You can't get away
We are one
We are one
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
We are one
We are one
