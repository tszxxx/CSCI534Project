it be a cold and wet December day 
when we touch the ground at J.F.K 
the snow be melt on the ground 
on b.l.s. I hear the sound 
New York like a Christmas tree 
tonight this city belong to I 
soul love 
well this love will not let I go 
so long 
Angel of Harlem 
Birdland on fifty three 
the street sound like a symphony 
we get John Coltrane and a love supreme 
mile say she be get to be a angel 
Lady Day get diamond eye 
she see the truth behind the lie 
Blue light on the avenue 
God know they get to you 
empty glass the lady sing 
eye swollen like a bee-sting 
blind you lose you way 
in the side street and the alleyway 
like a star explode in the night 
fill up the city with broad daylight 
angel in devil 's shoe 
salvation in the blue 
you never look like a angel 
Angel of Harlem
