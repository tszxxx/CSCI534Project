[Verse 1]
Can’t find the answers
I’ve been crawling on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning
Promises have been turned to lies
Can’t even be honest inside
Now I'm running backwards
Watching my life wave me goodbye
[Chorus 1]
Running blind
I’m running blind
Somebody help me see, I’m running blind
[Verse 2]
Searching for nothing
Wondering if I’ll change
I’m trying everything
But everything still stays the same
I thought if I showed you I could fly
Wouldn’t need anyone by my side
I'm going backwards
With broken wings I know I’ll die
[Chorus 2]
Running blind
I’m running blind
Somebody help me see, I’m running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
[Outro]
I can’t find the answers
I’ve been crawling on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning
I’m running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
Running blind
