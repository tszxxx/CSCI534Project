instinct that can still betray we 
a journey that lead to the sun 
soulless and bent on destruction 
a struggle between right and wrong 
you take my place in the showdown 
I will observe with a pitiful eye 
I will humbly ask for forgiveness 
a request well beyond you and I 
heart and soul one will burn 
heart and soul one will burn 
a abyss that laugh at creation 
a circus complete with all fool 
foundation that last the age 
then rip apart at they root 
beyond all this good be the terror 
the grip of a mercenary hand 
when savagery turn all good reason 
there be no turn back no last stand 
heart and soul one will burn 
heart and soul one will burn 
existence well what do it matter 
I exist on the best term I can and 
the past be now part of my future 
the present be well out of hand 
the present be well out of hand 
heart and soul one will burn 
heart and soul one will burn 
one will burn one will burn 
heart and soul one will burn
