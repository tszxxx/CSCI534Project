parole de la chanson people never give up 
a little sugar honey suckle lamb 
great expression of happiness 
Boy you could not miss with a dozen rose 
such would astound you 
the joy of child laugh around you 
these be the making of you 
it be true the making of you oh 
it be be a miracle for what you have do 
please stay right by my side 
two can be one for the righteous way to go 
anyone would know 
I believe I think I tell you so 
you be second to none 
love of all mankind should reflect some sign 
of the word I be try to recite 
they be close but not quite 
almost impossible to do 
describe the making of you
