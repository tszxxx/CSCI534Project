(intro)
Uh oh oh
Yeah
(chorus)
From a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still
(verse 1)
From a little cottage on the hill
Way down western Negril
This man sits
Is it Pining for your love
Jewie I miss you
How my lips wanna kiss you
I Called you on the phone
To my suprise you were not home
(chorus)
From a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still
(verse 2)
Brothers getting jay
Some sniffing cocaine
Some getting high
Licking sensimilla pie
Some getting high
Jennie sinsiminia cake
Then go west to watch sunsets at Rick\'s cafe
(chorus)
From a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still
(verse 3)
I love you
I love you baby
Yeah
Brothers getting jay
Some optain cocaine
Some getting high
Licking on the collie pie
Some getting high
Jennie sinsiminia cake
Then go west to watch sunsets at Rick\'s cafe
(chorus)
From a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still
