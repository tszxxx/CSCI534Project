[Verse 1:]
I was messed up, dirty as I could be
I was on my way to hell;
But I heard the preacher
Preaching the Word of God
Confess your sins and repent
[Chorus:]
I came to Jesus as I was
Weary, worn, and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made, made me glad
[Verse 2:]
I asked the Lord
"how could He love me
I have sinned against Your will"
But He said, "repent and I will forgive you
The question's who will you serve?"
[Verse 3:]
You might be dirty, messed up inside
You may even have lost your will to live;
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me
[Vamp 1:]
Weary
[Vamp 2:]
Jesus
