[Verse 1]
What you believe
Is the vanity you conceive
What you love you don't pen
To put in a cage is to put to an end
[Pre-Chorus]
Enamored of the passion
Life-sucking lust
You will never gain
My trust
[Chorus]
I'm a misanthropical breed
I am insatiable in my need to feed
[Verse 2]
Utterly fearless
For your luscious flesh
I've got an appetite like a war
And I always hunger for more
[Pre-Chorus]
Enamored of the passion
Life-sucking lust
You will never gain
My trust
[Chorus]
I'm a misanthropical breed
I am insatiable in my need to feed
[Outro]
Vicious mammal
The blood is my call
Pound for pound
I am the most vicious of all
