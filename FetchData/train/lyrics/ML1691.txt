[Verse 1]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love
[Chorus 1]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
[Chorus 2]
It's real love, yes it's real love
Oh, It's real love, yes it's real love
[Verse 2]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
[Chorus 2]
It's real love, yes it's real love
Oh, It's real love, yes it's real love
[Verse 3]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
It's real love, yes it's real love
Oh, It's real love, yes it's real love[x2]
