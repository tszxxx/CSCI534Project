I think that you could fly 
I think that you have wing 
I guess that I believe 
you would never say goodbye 
but my world stop turnin round 
the star turn upside down 
it knock I to the ground on my knee 
now there be a sad lookin moon 
Shinin down on I 
there be a sad lookin sky 
as far as I can see 
I always believe 
and I think the star could see 
but there be a sad lookin moon 
Shinin down on I 
I share with you my dream 
I give you everything 
I open up my heart 
and I give you my ring 
well I spend day and night 
just thinkin about the time 
when you would be mine all my life 
now there be a sad lookin moon 
Shinin down on I 
there be a sad lookin sky 
as far as I can see 
I always believe 
and I think the star could see 
but there be a sad lookin moon 
Shinin down on I 
there be a sad lookin moon 
a sad lookin moon 
there be a sad lookin moon 
Shinin down on I
