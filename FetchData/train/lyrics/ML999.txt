[Verse 1]
I've been down, and I'm wondering why
These little black clouds keep walking around
With me
With me
It wastes time, and I'd rather be high
Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile
But be free
They're all free
[Chorus]
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
[Verse 2]
I look around at a beautiful life
I've been the upperside of down, been the inside of out
But we breathe
We breathe
I wanna breeze and an open mind
I wanna swim in the ocean, wanna take my time
For me
All me
[Chorus]
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
