I have be outside 
invite in 
but I could not abide 
go miss again 
burn every bridge that I cross 
to find some beautiful place to get lose 
I have true love 
I make it die 
I push she away 
she say please stay 
burn every bridge that I cross 
to find some beautiful place to get lose 
to find some beautiful place to get lose 
well I do not know where I will go now 
and I do not really care who follow I there 
but I will burn every bridge that I cross 
and find some beautiful place to get lose 
and find some beautiful place to get lose
