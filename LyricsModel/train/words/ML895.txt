liiiiy 
turn around they might be watch 
and you never disappoint they 
hide you innocence before they see right through 
you must not disappoint they 
you need the danger just to feel you heart beat 
you need to die just to find you identity 
you need the knife just to know that you can bleed 
you need the pain now just to feel anything 
we fall in line 
we live the lie 
give up give up and feed the machine 
it grow inside 
nowhere to hide 
give up give up and feed the machine 
give up give up and feed the machine 
they pull you faster 
the cadence calling 
and you never fall behind 
so choose a face you only calling out 
you must not fall behind 
you need another death just to have a life to save 
you need a master just so you can beg 
you need a light just because you be so afraid 
now bow down and learn to be a good slave 
we fall in line 
we live the lie 
give up give up and feed the machine 
it grow inside 
nowhere to hide 
give up give up and feed the machine 
give up give up and feed the machine 
go back to sleep 
go back to sleep 
wake up 
wake up 
wake up 
wake up 
we fall in line 
we live the lie 
give up give up and feed the machine 
it grow inside 
nowhere to hide 
wake up wake up and kill the machine 
wake up wake up and kill the machine 
wake up wake up and kill the machine
