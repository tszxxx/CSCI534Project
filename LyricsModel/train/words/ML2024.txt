I be dream of a white Christmas 
just like the one I use to know 
where the tree top glisten and child listen 
to hear sleigh bell in the snow 
yes I be dream of a white white Christmas 
with with every Christmas card I write 
may you day be be merry and bright 
and may all you you christmase be white be white 
I I be dream of a white white Christmas 
with every Christmas card I write 
may you day be be merry and bright 
and may all you christmase be white 
I all you christmase 
I hope all you christmase to be white 
I want you christmase to be white 
jingle bell Christmas carol 
Children wish you christmase be white 
I want you christmase to be whiter

I want all you christmase to be white 
every time it get to be white 
when I be
