[Instrumental Intro]
My victims are rich or poor, young or old, strong or weak. I cause millions of accidents. I am cancer in your bones. I fathered the lie. Twist what you say, speak not the truth. I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes. I take what you love and leave you in tears. I imprison your soul. Your hopes are my games. I strip you of pride. My promise is in vain. While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames. I bring poverty, sickness, and death. A worthless handshake, the slickest thief. I steal your wealth. I answer your prayers for greed and lust. More than evil, I laugh at your trust. I am more powerful than all the armies of the world. I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death. I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars. I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath!
[Short Instrumental Break]
Evil - more evil than violence
Violent - more violent than death
Deadly - more deadly than man
I am - Yeah, yeah, I'm evil, I am
My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love and leave you in tears
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames
My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The most beautiful angel

Unpredictable the Prince of darkness
