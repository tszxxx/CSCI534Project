[Intro]
This is not a love song
This is not a love song, this is not a love song
This is not a love song, this is not a love song
I'm crossing over (This is not a love song)
This is not a love song, this is not a love song
This is not a love song, this is not a love song
[Chorus]
This is not a love song, this is not a love song
This is not a love song, this is not a love song
This is not a love song
[Verse 1]
This is not a love song
Happy to have, not to have not
Big business is very wise
I'm crossing over into enterprise
[Chorus]
This is not a love song (This is not a love song)
This is not a love song (This is not a love song)
This is not a love song (This is not a love song)
Oh no
[Verse 2]
I'm adaptable and I like my new role
I'm getting better and better, I have a new goal
I'm changing my ways where money applies
This is not a love song
[Chorus]
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
[Verse 3]
I'm going over to the other side
I'm happy to have, not to have not
Big business is very wise
I'm inside free enterprise
[Chorus]
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
[Bridge]
Not television
Behind the curtain
Out of the cupboard
[Verse 4]
You take the first train into the big world
Are you ready to grab the candle?
That tunnel vision, not television
Behind the curtain, out of the cupboard
[Chorus]
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
[Chorus x2]
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
[Outro]
This is not a love song
Happiness and sunshine
This is not a love song
No no, no no
No no, no no
No no, no no
No no, no no
