[Intro]
Do, dododo, lalala, lalala, lalala
Do, dododo, lalala, lalala, lalala
[Verse 1]
Are you ready to take the chance and risk it all?
It's do or die, fight or flight
Do you want to feel alive?
So would you play a game of Russian Roulette
To save your life, are you in, are you in?
Or will you flee to safety, and wonder what could have been?
Don't be afraid, don't ever be afraid
Oh, now you've been hiding, you've been hiding
You've been hiding in the shadows
[Chorus]
You're afraid, when you're afraid
Take a chance don't let it weigh you down
You've got to get out of here
You're afraid, when you're afraid
Take a chance don't let it wear you down
You've got to get out
[Verse 2]
You're trapped in the cave, confined
Falling back to the comfort of your world
Last time you walked away from this
You were looking back to see what you missed
Do, dododo, lalala, lalala, lalala
Do, dododo, lalala, lalala, lalala
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Take a chance, take a breath
Take a shot with a gun to your head
Take a chance, take a breath
Take a shot like the gun is to your head
Like the gun is to your head, oh
Do, dododo, lalala, lalala, lalala
Oh, lalala, lalala, lalala, lalala
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Stop hiding in the shadows
