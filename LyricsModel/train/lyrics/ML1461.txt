[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Dark is the light, the man you fight
With all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day
Of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold this bounty soul
A gentile or a priest?
Who victored over, the Seljuks
When the holy land was taken
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Was it the riches of the land
Powers of bright darkness
That lead the nobles to the East
To fight the heathens!
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it
No International security
No call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill a man
History teaches us so
The reason he must attain
Must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore!
[Chorus]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens!
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
