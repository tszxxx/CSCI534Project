MATADJEM YINMIXAN (Why all this hate between you)
MATADJEM YINMIXAN SARHREMT YARATAN
Why all this hate between you which you teach your children
TOJAWAN ALRHALEM TATERARAWAN
The world looks at you and surpasses your understanding
WAR TOLIHAM ID'KOUFAR WAR TOLIHAM D'ARABAN
You who resemble neither a westerner nor an Arab
TOMANAM ISTIWSATEN TIDIT TINDARAWAN
Your faith in the tribes blinds you to the truth
WADA AL ASSAWKA IYALAH WALAIYEN DOWAN ADAHAR
Even if God were to send a blessing down for you to share
D'IMIDINET TAFLIST IS WADEK ATEKDAR
With a friend, they will only betray your confidence
