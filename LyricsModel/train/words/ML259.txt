to all the traveler 
pilgrim long for a home 
from one who walk with you 
on this journey call life 's road 
it be a long and wind road 
from one who be see the view 
and dream of stay on the mountain high 
and one who be cry like you 
want so much to lay down and die 
I offer this we must remember this 
we be not home yet 
we be not home yet 
keep on look ahead 
let you heart not forget 
we be not home yet 
not home yet 
so close you eye with I 
and hear the Father say welcome home 
let we find the strength 
in all he promise to carry on 
he say I go prepare a place for you 
so let we not forget 
we be not home yet 
we be not home yet 
keep on look ahead 
let you heart not forget 
we be not home yet 
we be not home yet 
keep on look ahead 
let you heart not forget 
we be not home yet 
I know there will be a moment 
I know there will be a place 
where we will see we savior 
and fall in he embrace 
so let we not grow weary 
or too content to stay 
cause we be not home yet 
we be not home yet 
not home yet 
so let we journey on 
we be not home yet 
we be not home yet 
keep on look ahead 
let you heart not forget 
we be not home yet 
not home yet
