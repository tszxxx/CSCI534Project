[Verse 1]
So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue

If all you told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed was new
Imagine sky high above
In Caribbean blue
