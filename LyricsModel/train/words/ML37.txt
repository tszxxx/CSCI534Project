you be not alone 
I be with you 
I be lonely too 
what be that song 
that can not be sung by two 
a broken home 
a broken heart 
isolated and afraid 
open up this be a raid 
I want to get it through to you 
you be not alone 
you be not alone 
every night 
I stand in you place 
every tear 
on every face 
taste the same 
a broken dream 
a broken heart 
isolated and afraid 
open up this be a raid 
I be go to get it through to you 
you be not alone 
a open hand 
a open heart 
there be no need to be afraid 
open up this be a raid 
I want to get it through to you 
you be not alone 
I want to get it through to you 
you be not alone 
I be go to get it through to you 
you be not alone
