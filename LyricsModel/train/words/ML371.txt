well we get no choice 
all the girl and boy 
makin all that noise 
cause they find new toy 
well we can not salute ya 
can not find a flag 
if that do not suit ya 
that be a drag 
school be out for summer 
school be out forever 
school be be blow to piece 
no more pencil 
no more book 
no more teacher 's dirty look 
well we get no class 
and we get no principle 
and we get no innocence 
we can not even think of a word that rhyme 
school be out for summer 
school be out forever 
my school be be blow to piece 
no more pencil 
no more book 
no more teacher 's dirty look 
out for summer 
out till fall 
we might not come back at all 
school be out forever 
school be out for summer 
school be out with fever 
school be out completely
