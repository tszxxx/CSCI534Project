I know it be out of fashion 
and a trifle uncool 
but I can not help it 
I be a romantic fool 
it be a habit of mine 
to watch the sun go down 
on echo Beach I watch the sun go down 
from nine to five I have to spend my time at work 
my job be very boring I be a office clerk 
the only thing that help I pass the time away 
be know I will be back at Echo Beach someday 
on a silent summer evening 
the sky be alive with light 
a building in the distance 
surrealistic sight 
on Echo Beach 
wafe make the only sound 
on Echo Beach 
there be not a soul around 
from nine to five I have to spend my time at work 
my job be very boring I be a office clerk 
the only thing that help I pass the time away 
be know I will be back at Echo Beach someday 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time 
Echo Beach far away in time
