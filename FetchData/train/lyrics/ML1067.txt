[Verse 1: Karyn White]
I used to think that love was so silly
Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
It never was for me, no, not really
But there was not a guy who was special enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way
[Chorus: Karyn White]
Love saw it
Hey, love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy, boy, ooh
[Babyface]
Oh, you bring me joy
Me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
[Verse 2: Babyface]
I used to think that love was a mystery
Something that a guy just could not figure out
And I never had no past history
Not even a clue what true love was about
[Pre-Chorus]
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
I was so, so anticipating
Girl, I didn't know I had love inside of me
[Chorus: Babyface]
Love saw it, hoo
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
[Bridge]
[Babyface]
Oh, girl
My, my girl
I never thought that I could love a girl the way I do
[Karyn White]
Oh, boy
My, my, my, my boy
I'm so glad that I found your love too
[Chorus: Karyn White]
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy, oh
[Chorus: Babyface]
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it, love saw it, love saw it, love, love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
[Breakdown: Karyn White &amp; 
Babyface
]
You bring me joy
Me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
You bring me joy
Me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
Keep on bringing me
Keep on bringing me
Joy, joy
Joy
[Karyn White &amp; Babyface]
Love called my name
Love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name
Love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain

[Babyface]

Love saw, love saw, love, di-di-di love

[Karyn White]
I just can't explain it
My heart can't contain it
