guess there be time when we all need to share a little pain 
and iron out the rough spot 
be the hardest part when memory remain 
and it be time like these when we all need to hear the radio 
cause from the lip of some old singer 
we can share the trouble we already know 
turn they on turn they on 
turn on those sad song 
when all hope be go 
why do not you tune in and turn they on 
they reach into you room 
just feel they gentle touch 
when all hope be go 
sad song say so much 
if someone else be suffer enough to write it dow and 
when every single word make sense 
then it be easier to have those song around 
the kick inside be in the line that finally get to you 
and it feel so good to hurt so bad 
and suffer just enough to sing the blue 
sad song they say 
sad song they say 
sad song they say 
sad song they say so much
