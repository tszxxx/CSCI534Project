be not it just like one of we 
to pick up the phone and call after a couple drink 
and say how you be I have be wonder if 
maybe you have be thinkin about I 
and somewhere in the conversation 
a old familiar invitation always arrive 
I may hate myself in the morning 
but I be go to love you tonight 
everyone be know someone that they 
just can not help but want 
even though we just can not make it work out 
the want to linger on 
so once again we wind up in each other 's arm 
pretend that it be right 
and I may hate myself in the morning 
but I be go to love you tonight 
I know it be wrong but it be not easy movin on 
so why can not two friend 
remember the good time once again 
tomorrow when I wake up 
I will be feelin a little guilty a little sad 
thinkin how it use to be before everything go bad 
I guess that be what it be all lonely 
late night call like this that we try to find 
I may hate myself in the morning 
but I be go to love you tonight 
I may hate msyelf in the morning 
but I be go to love you tonight
