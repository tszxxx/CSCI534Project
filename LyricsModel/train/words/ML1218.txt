why let this world just wait on you shoulder 
pick it up push it off before you let yourself get colder 
just look into the eye the good eye of a child 
and see that love rise like a river and float for a thousand mile

Breathin deep feel you heart beat 
just to know that life 's worth living 
feel you foot on the earth you better love it while it be still here spinning 
I get no time to worry about trouble on 
you get to let it flow let yourself go

I go and eat this daily bread 
but so many people starve 
how come the president just build more bomb 
when nation start dissolve 
with all that money spend on gun 's stead of food and education 
need to buy a little peace and love instead start the healing of the nation
