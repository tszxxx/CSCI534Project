[Verse 1]
Tired of this, done with that
Never satisfied with where I'm at
I sit and think what to do
Just a motherfuckin' bore without a clue
Shot my drugs, drank my booze
Tired of joy and self-abuse
Eternally jaded, through and through
Just a self-loathing dick without a clue
[Chorus]
Oh, bored to death, I'm just bored to tears
Same old shit, just different day and year
Killed myself, but that got boring too
So beyond the point where it's not true
[Verse 2]
Far beyond high, dramatically low
Eternal stare, as if I care to know
All of this struggle, all of this work
In the end, you die like some moronic jerk
Shot my drugs, drank my booze
Tired of joy and self-abuse
Eternally jaded, through and through
Just a self-loathing fuck without a clue
[Chorus]
Oh, bored to death, I'm just bored to tears
Same old shit, just different day and year
Killed myself, but that got boring too
So beyond the point where it's not true
[Bridge]
The colors I see are all bleeding
The sound that was, is now standing still
I wonder when it was it all faded
A dullen corpse that cannot be killed
[Chorus]
Oh, bored to death, I'm just bored to tears
Same old shit, just different day and year
Killed myself, but that got boring too
So beyond the point where it's not true
