To rest my eyes in shades of green
Under dreaming spires
To Itchycoo Park. That&#039;s where I&#039;ve been.
(What did you do there?)
I got high...
(What did you feel there?)
Well, I cried...
(But why the tears then?)
Tell you why...
It&#039;s all too beautiful! (4x)
I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;ll do.
(What will you do?)
I&#039;d like to go there now with you,
You can miss out school.
(Won&#039;t that be cool?)
Why go to hear the words of fools?
(What did you do there?)
I got high...
(What did you touch there?)
I touched the sky...
(But why the tears then?)
I&#039;ll tell you why...
It&#039;s all too beautiful! (4x)
I feel inclined to blow my mind,
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun.
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun.
(What did you do there?)
I got high...
(What did you touch there?)
I touched the sky...
(But why the tears then?)
Tell you why...
(It&#039;s all too beautiful!) {4x}
It&#039;s all so beautiful. (It&#039;s all too beautiful!) {4x}
