lie in my bed I hear the clock tick 
and think of you 
turn in circle confusion 
be nothing new 
flashback to warm night 
almost leave behind 
suitcase of memory 
time after 
sometimes you picture I 
I be walk too far ahead 
you be call to I I can not hear 
what you have say 
and you say go slow 
I have fall behind 
the second hand unwind 
if you be lose you can look and you will find I 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you I will be wait 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you I will be wait 
time after time 
time after time 
after you picture fade and darkness have 
turn to gray 
watch through window I be wonder 
if you be ok 
you say go slow 
I fall behind 
the drum beat out of time 
if you be lose you can look and you will find I 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you I will be wait 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you I will be wait 
time after time 
time after time 
time after time 
time after time 
time after time 
time after time 
time after time 
time after time
