the shadow of the reaper the shadow of the dead 
Entombs the lifeless 
the darkest black be cast 
the shadow of the reaper will you take it 's hand 
the shadow of the reaper the grave now call to you 
in the cemetary 
you have be leave unburied 
the vulture pick at you eye 
the cold grasp a blood hand 
the skeleton it crack 
and it be twitch 
inside of you body 
the brain retreat 
the heart beat no longer 
in denial 
life no longer there 
to comfort 
to invigorate 
to betray you 
the rotten now await you 
meet the Devil 's keeper 
in the shadow of the reaper 
the rotten now await you 
to invade you 
the shadow of the reaper the shadow of the dead 
Entombs the lifeless 
the darkest black be cast 
the shadow of the reaper will you take it hand 
the shadow of the reaper the grave now call to you 
in the cemetary 
you have be leave unburied 
the vulture pick at you eye
