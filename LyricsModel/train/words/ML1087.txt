wear 
day go by 
then the night 
dead end 
wear 
in the jump cut 
I be wait wait for the 
Morning 
breathe in 
Subway train 
silence remain 
playback on repeat 
I be wait wait for it 
Chorus 
away 
I wait 
nowhere to go 
slow motion 
delay 
nowhere to go 
Dark eye 
hand cold 
uncontrol 
defer 
arctic heart repeat 
I be wait wait for it 
Chorus 
away 
I wait 
nowhere to go 
slow motion 
delay 
nowhere to go 
nowhere to go 
day 
away 
after day 
I wait 
Drop away 
nowhere to go 
dead end 
wear in the jump cut 
slow motion delay 
I be wait 
nowhere to go 
wait for it 
Sport in the night 
away I wait 
want more 
nowhere to go 
wake for 
playback on repeat 
slow motion delay 
I be wait 
nowhere to go 
wait for it 
day after day 
away I wait 
Drop away 
nowhere to go 
defer 
playback on repeat 
slow motion delay 
I be wait 
nowhere to go 
wait for it 
nowhere to go
