[Verse 1]
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
[Pre-Chorus]
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love
[Chorus]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Yeah
[Verse 2]
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
[Pre-Chorus]
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love
[Chorus]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah
[Bridge]
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane (come, come, come, come)
Come play the game, play the game, play the game
Play the game
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
[Pre-Chorus]
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world), all you have to do is fall in love
[Chorus]
Play the game, yeah
Everybody play the game of love
[Pre-Chorus]
Your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world), all you have to do is fall in love
[Chorus]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
