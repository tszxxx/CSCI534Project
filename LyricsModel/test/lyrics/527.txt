[Verse 1]
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill, when I found you
[Verse 2]
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dream came true
[Bridge 1]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be
[Verse 3]
Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
[Bridge 2]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were only to be
[Verse 4]
Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
