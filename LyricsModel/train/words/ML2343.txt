lie on my back wheel under blind light 
shackle restraint resist my attempt fight 
the scalpel hover over I the incision be make 
once again they be watch I no new sensation just frustration 
they say it be for science 
but I be the human guinea pig 
the guinea pig 
the guinea pig 
the guinea pig 
the guinea pig 
the guinea pig 
my sleep have be alter I open my eye 
the nightmare continue I see through they lie 
the papers keep turn the test never end 
once again they be watch I no new sensation just frustration 
they say it be for science 
but I feel like the human guinea pig 
time may have pass on but I will not soon forget 
the old sensation pure frustration of a human guinea guinea pig
