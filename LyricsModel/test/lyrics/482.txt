He loves her when she's sleeping
And all the dreams she's keeping
She keeps him in a jar but not too far from her heart
They have the good kind of love
Good kind of love, good kind of love
They have the right kind of thing
Right kind of thing, right kind of thing
Makes me wanna sing it to you
Just him and her
They're so close together
Now they just met
And scored a newfound treasure
Woah, woah
Run to him, run to him
Right in his arms
They have the good kind
They have the good kind
They have the good kind of love
Now she finds peace in knowing (She knows)
Knowing he'll always be there (Always)
Imagine all the women who'd like a man like him
They have the good kind of love
Good kind of love, good kind of love
They have the right kind of thing
Right kind of thing, right kind of thing
Makes me wanna sing it to you
Just him and her
They're so close together
Now they just met
And scored a newfound treasure
Woah, woah
Run to him, run to him
Right to his arms, yeah
They have the good kind
They have the good kind
They have the good kind of love
Sun keeps on shining
He rolls round heaven above
A little bit of loving and a-kissin' and a-huggin'
That's how they fell in love
They have the good kind
They have the good kind
They have the good kind of love
