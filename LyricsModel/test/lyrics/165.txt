[Verse 1]
Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that
[Chorus]
I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
[Verse 2]
Think of a Hank song from days gone
With a steel rod that's so strong,  sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that
[Chorus]
I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm  not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from lovers but they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you and then take back
I'm a little more country than that
[Outro]
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that
