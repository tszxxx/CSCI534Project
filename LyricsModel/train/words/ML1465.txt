ohhhh 
the fire the fire 
ohhhh 
the fire the fire 
there be something in you heart 
and it be in you eye 
it be the fire inside you 
let it burn 
you do not say good luck 
you say do not give up 
it be the fire inside you 
let it burn 
yeah and if I be ever at the crossroad 
and start feel mix signal like Morse code 
my soul start to grow colder than the North Pole 
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch go 
and in tradition of these legendary sport pro 
as far as I can see I have make it to the threshold 
Lord know I have wait for this a lifetime 
and I be a icon when I let my light shine 
shine bright as a example of a champion 
take the advantage never cop out or cancel 
burn like a chariot learn how to carry it 
Maverick always above and beyond average 
fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with 
something in my eye say I be so close to have the prize 
I realize I be suppose to reach for the sky 
never let somebody try to tell you otherwise 
there be something in you heart 
and it be in you eye 
it be the fire inside you 
let it burn 
you do not say good luck 
you say do not give up 
it be the fire inside you 
let it burn 
one love one game one desire 
one flame one bonfire let it burn higher 
I never show sign of fatigue or turn tired 
cause I be the definition of tragedy turn triumph 
it be David and Goliath I make it to the eye of the storm 
feel tear like they feed I to the lion 
before my time start to wind down like the Mayans 
I show them how I get the grind down like a science 
it sound like a riot on hush it be so quiet 
the only thing I hear be my heart I be inspire 
by the challenge that I find myself stand eye to eye with 
then move like a wise warrior and not a coward 
you can not escape the history that you be mean to make 
that be why the highest victory be what I be mean to take 
you come to celebrate I come to cerebrate 
I hate lose I refuse to make the same mistake 
ohhhh 
the fire the fire 
ohhhh 
the fire the fire 
there be something in you heart 
and it be in you eye 
it be the fire inside you 
let it burn 
you do not say good luck 
you say do not give up 
it be the fire inside you 
let it burn 
ohhhh 
the fire inside you 
the fire inside you 
the fire inside you
