[Verse 1]
Spending my day
Thinking about you, girl
Being here with yo, being near, I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do
Though it hurts me so
To let you know when I look in your eyes
And it lets me know how you feel
Let me know that your love is really real
And it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love
[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still, still in love with you
That I'm still, sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Don't you know that I'm still, still in love with you
That I'm still, sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
[Verse 2]
When I look in your eyes
And all these years, years I see
Honey, me loving you and you loving me, but it seems to me, yeah
That I'm so wrapped up in your love
[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still, sho' 'nuff in love with you
And I...
And I...
Don't you know that I'm still, sho' 'nuff in love with you
Said I'm still, do what you want me to
And I've tried and tried, don't know what else to do, yeah
[Outro]
I...
Do what you want me to, yeah
I...
Can't you see I tried and tried and tried
Don't you know that I'm still, sho' 'nuff in love with you, baby
I want you to know it
Hey...
My, my baby, yeah
Baby, yeah, still up in love with you
'Cause I'm so, so, so, so, so, so, so
Hey, I'm still in love with you, baby
Do what you want me to, 'cause I love you, yeah
Some say, say, that I'm still in love with you
