you can show I the way 
give I a sunny day 
but what do it mean 
without you love 
and if I could travel far 
if I could touch the star 
where would I be 
without you love 
whenever I get to feeling 
down and out 
I think about what you say 
and then I would give out 
and if I could fly away 
if I could sail today 
where would I go 
without you love 
you can show I the way 
and give I a sunny day 
but what do it mean 
without you love 
and if I could travel far 
if I could touch the star 
where would I be 
without you love 
and if I ever wonder away 
too far 
you would come look for I with 
open arm 
I could forget my home 
be like a roll stone 
but who would I be 
without you love 
and what do it mean 
without you love 
where would I be
