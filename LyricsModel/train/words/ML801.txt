I can not begin to explain 
how we disassemble 
the part and frame 
maybe it be the same late morning 
the same no -show 
it be the same fuck habit 
I guess we do not know 
all of this be tear we apart 
I do not know where we or this start 
all of this be tear we apart 
I do not know where we or this start 
if there be anyone near when we collide 
we throw they in the middle 
they can pick side 
as the plan turn into compromise 
the promise all turn to lie 
the spite build up and I can not get through 
passive I aggressive you 
I know I nag I moan I know 
but with a plan like this it be way too slow 
in the time it take to get this bad 
I could have make this work but all I have 
be the hope that piece would take shape 
and we could watch they all fall into place 
fall into place 
all of this be tear we apart 
I do not know where we or this start 
all of this be tear we apart 
I do not know where we or this start
