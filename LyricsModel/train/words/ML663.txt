this be for freedom 
this be for those who care 
I get my reason 
no more in despair 
we stand united 
this be decide 
the hand of fury 
you be all invite 
I crawl out of this nightmare 
out of the shadow 
I walk into the devil 's lair 
my life 
my path 
be where faith grow 
cause I be still alive 
feed the ﬁre inside 
I be 
I be still alive 
the fuel 
the ﬂame 
will ignite 
this be the threshold 
this be the quickening 
no more rampage 
in the battle ring 
fight for independence 
for what you believe 
the right to stand out 
the glory to receive 
I crawl out of this nightmare 
out of the shadow 
I walk into the devil 's lair 
my life 
my path 
be where faith grow 
cause I be still alive 
feed the ﬁre inside 
I be 
I be still alive 
the fuel 
the ﬂame 
will ignite 
take now what I have learn from 
all these year of agony 
and bring it 
take now 
what I have learn from all these year of agony 
and bring it to you 
bring it here tonight
