when I be eighteen everything be alive 
then the plane hit the tower 
then she die 

then he die 
a part of I disappear six foot in the ground 
million mile in the sky a fire burn 
a fire burn a fire burn and it be mine 
and I do what I do 
what we do to survive 
five whole year of my life I spend mourn you and why 
girl you be still alive 
you be too dead to keep inside 
you take the year you keep it all 
I finally think I might be alright 
so let just let it all go cause nothing can change 
and if something be lose then there be something to frame 
I just sing what I have 
and I get this girl not yet crush by the world 
I will count the freckle on she face one two three hundred 
time a day 
and sing a new song 
something I would never hear 
it be better love that I find bigger love that you fear 
so deep inside I hot in this frozen cave 
she fire burn she fire burn she fire burn and it be brave 
when I be eighteen everything be alive 
then the plane hit the tower 
then she die then he die 
a part of I disappear six foot in the ground 
million mile in the sky a fire burn 
a fire burn and I just let be all go 
and I will not fear change 
and if something be lose then there be something to frame 
I will just sing what I have in the heaven above 
in the song in the sky a fire burn 
a fire burn a fire burn and it be for you
