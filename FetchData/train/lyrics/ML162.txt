[Verse 1]
And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood, it's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good
[Post-Verse]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good
[Verse 2]
And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good
[Post-Verse]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good
[Chorus]
Oh, I love, oh, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
[Guitar solo: Henry McCullough]
[Post-Verse]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good
[Verse 3]
Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love, she does it good
[Post-Verse]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good
[Outro]
Oh, I love, oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
