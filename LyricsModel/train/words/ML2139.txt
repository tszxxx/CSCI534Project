you see this girl 
this girl 's in love with you 
yes I be in love 
who look at you the way I do 
when you smile I can tell we know each other very well 
how can I show you I be glad I get to know you cause 
I have hear some talk they say you think I be fine 
this girl 's in love and what I would do to make you mine 
tell I now be it so do not let I be the last to know 
my hand be shakin do not let my heart keep breaking cause 
I need you love I want you love 
say you be in love and you will be my guy 
if not I will just die 
tell I now be it so do not let I be the last to know 
my hand be shakin do not let my heart keep breaking cause 
I need you love I want you love 
say you be in love and you will be my guy 
if not I will just die 
my hand be shakin' do not let my heart keep breaking
