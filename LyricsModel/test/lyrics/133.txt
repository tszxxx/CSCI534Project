[Verse 1]
LET'S GO!
This is a battle call
To one to all
The opposition
Who will take the fall
Are you sick of just getting by?
Are you tired of the fucking crying?
Are you looking for a better life?
[Chorus]
Change or die
We're looking for the answers of our lives
Tonight
You got to change or die
The answer is for you to do what's right
Tonight
[Verse 2]
Are you corrupted
By the status quo?
The repetition
It kills us all
Is the rat race dragging you down
Are you stuck in that dead end town?
Are you looking for the way out?
[Chorus]
Change or die
We're looking for the answers of our lives
Tonight
You got to change or die
The answer is for you to do what's right
Tonight
[Verse 3]
YEAH!
We won't go down
Not tonight
This is our battle cry
We're ready to fight
We won't go down
Not tonight
This is our battle cry we're ready to fight
[Chorus]
Change or die
We're looking for the answers of our lives
Tonight
You got to change or die
The answer is for you to do what's right
Tonight
[Outro]
CHANGE OR DIE![x2]
