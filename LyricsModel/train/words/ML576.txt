on gentle ground 
I wait for you 
in drop of dew 
I wish they be you 
with heavy hand 
I reach out for you 
my skin soaking wet 
my eye search for you 
it seem you lose you way 
you have let it all fall apart 
nothing be leave here but you 
all you do be remind I 
now that we have lose we way 
the rest can all fall apart 
all I see here be you 
all it do be remind I 
with sharpen tongue 
I cry out for you 
and must I refrain 
now that I need you 
the autumn wind feel 
as if it be you 
and sway through the field 
where I once hold you 
it seem you lose you way 
you have let it all fall apart 
nothing be leave here but you 
all you do be remind I 
now that we have lose we way 
the rest can all fall apart 
all I see here be you 
all it do be remind I 
whistle through you window 
we act the same as you
