in the shuffling madness 
of the locomotive breath 
run the all time loser 
headlong to he death 
he feel the piston scraping 
steam break on he brow 
old Charlie steal the handle 
and the train it will not stop go 
no way to slow down 
oh oh 
he see he child jump off 
at the station one by one 
he woman and he best friend 
in bed and have fun 
he be crawl down the corridor 
on he hand and knee 
old Charlie steal the handle and 
the train it will not stop go 
no way to slow down 
hey hey 
he hear the silence howling 
catch angel as they fall 
and the all time winner 
have get he by the ball 
oh he pick up Gideon 's Bible 
open at page one 
I say God he steal the handle and 
the train it will not stop goin 
no way to slow down 
no way to slow down 
no way to slow down 
no way to slow down 
no way to slow down 
no way to slow down
