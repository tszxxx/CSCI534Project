I can not stay mad at you 
you can make I cry 
you can break my heart 
but I will never say we be through 
and even when I shout 
I can not stay mad at you 
I can not stay mad at you 
I get mad at you last night 
when you be hold 
another girl tight 
but when I think about all you charm 
I bounce right back into you arm 
I think you will know for sure 
I will not be the one to fall in love with someone new 
I will never say goodbye 
I can not stay mad at you
