tired of this do with that 
never satisfied with where I be at 
I sit and think what to do 
just a motherfuckin bore without a clue 
shot my drug drank my booze 
tired of joy and self abuse 
eternally jaded through and through 
just a self loathing dick without a clue 
oh bored to death I be just bored to tear 
same old shit just different day and year 
kill myself but that get boring too 
so beyond the point where it be not true 
far beyond high dramatically low 
eternal stare as if I care to know 
all of this struggle all of this work 
in the end you die like some moronic jerk 
shot my drug drank my booze 
tired of joy and self abuse 
eternally jaded through and through 
just a self loathing fuck without a clue 
oh bored to death I be just bored to tear 
same old shit just different day and year 
kill myself but that get boring too 
so beyond the point where it be not true 
the color I see be all bleed 
the sound that be be now stand still 
I wonder when it be it all faded 
a dullen corpse that can not be kill 
oh bored to death I be just bored to tear 
same old shit just different day and year 
kill myself but that get boring too 
so beyond the point where it be not true
