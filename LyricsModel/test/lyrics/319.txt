It's the little old lady from Pasadena
The little old lady from Pasadena
(Go granny, go granny, go granny go)
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
(Go granny, go granny, go granny go)
But parked in her rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red Super Stock Dodge
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from 
Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of 
Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
You might drive a goer but you'll never lose her
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Well, she's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's a terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
~Instrumental~
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
~Instrumental~
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give 'em a length then she'll shut 'em down
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's a terror out on Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
