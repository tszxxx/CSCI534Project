do not know why there 's no sun up in the sky , stormy weather since my gal and I be not together , keep rain all the time Life be bare , gloom and misery everywhere , stormy weather just can not get my poor old self together I be weary all the time , the time so weary all the time when she go away the bly walk in and they meet I if she stay away , that old rock chair 's go to get I all I do be pray the Lord above will let I walk in the sun once more can not go on , everything I have be go , stormy weather since my gal and I be not together keep rain all the time keep rain all the time can not go on , everything I have be go , stormy weather since my gal and I be not together keep rain all the time , the time keep rain all the time
