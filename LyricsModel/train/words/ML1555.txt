soon time for a cleaning day 
onward ride the van 
sweep in by discolor waste 
sickness creep on the hall 
and the death of I 
almost as we burn and play 
ant just do not belong 
in this place you call you own 
search for a favorite flower 
narrow with the hall 
sweep in by discolor waste 
almost as we burn and play 
ant just do not belong 
in this place you call you own 
danger 's taller tree 
do not look so good to I 
they will not grow again 
lead to final peace 
and this dilute stream 
they do not break for they
