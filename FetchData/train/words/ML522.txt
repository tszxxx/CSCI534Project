I force myself through another day , can not explain the way today just fall apart like everything , right in my face and I try to be the one , I can not accept this all because of you I have have to walk away , from everything and I be afraid to be alone afraid you would leave I when I be go I be afraid to come back home another sleepless night again , Hotel room my only friend and friend like that just do not add up , to anything and I try so hard to be , everything that I should never take away from you again , ' cause I hear you say and I be afraid to be alone afraid you would leave I when I be go I be afraid to come back home I can not forget I live with regret I can not forget I live with ... I live through this I can not see through this I can not do this anymore ' cause I be afraid to be alone afraid you would leave I when I be go I be afraid to come back home afraid you would leave I when I be go and I just wish i be back home
