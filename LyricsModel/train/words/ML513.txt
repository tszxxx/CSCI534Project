you be my thrill 
you do something to I 
you send chill right through I 
when I look at you 
cause you be my thrill 
you be my thrill 
how my pulse increase 
I just go to piece 
when I look at you 
cause you be my thrill 
nothing seem to matter 
here be my heart on a silver platter 
where be my will 
why this strange desire 
that keep mount higher 
when I look at you 
I can not keep still 
you my thrill 
you know you be my thrill 
nothing seem to matter 
here be my heart on a silver platter 
where be my will 
why this strange desire 
that keep mount higher 
when I look at you 
I can not keep still 
you my thrill 
you know you be my thrill
