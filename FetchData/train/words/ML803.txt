I be high tonight , lookin ' for some fun rage metal , with spike and chain - Chorus - I be a skull splitter ' till the brink of dawn Drank too many thousand on the lawn I be a skull splitter thrash ' till the end Kickin ' ass , ' cause it feel great up at dawn , the rise dead we be conquer , in Balingen rage metal with spike and chain and all the woman , I be a skull splitter I be a skull splitter I be a skull splitter
