[Verse 1]
There's a girl on a ledge, she's got nowhere to turn
'Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned
Now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern
She can blame the world, or 
prey till dawn
[Chorus]
But only love can breakerfall
Breakerfall
Only love can breakerfall
Fall
[Verse 2]
It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth
And she's standing outside hating everyone here
She's her own disease, crying to her doll
[Chorus]
Yeah
[Outro]
Fall, breakerfall
Can breakerfall
Ooh yeah, only love can breakerfall
Love, love, can breakerfall, fall
Love, love, can breakerfall
Only love can breakerfall
