[Verse 1]
Kill your enemies
My brothers dead around me
Wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me
Smoke is blinding
Hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The call is made, it's one for all
Will I meet my maker?
[Pre-Chorus]
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die
[Chorus]
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Charge!
[Verse 2]
Fuck this battlefield
The bullets tear around me
Bodies falling
Voices calling for me
Limbs are flying
Men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The call is made, it's one for all
Take no prisoners
[Pre-Chorus]
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die
[Chorus]
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
[Bridge]
Scream, aim, fire!
Scream, aim, fire!
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die
[Chorus]
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
[Outro]
Oh!
Scream, aim, fire!
