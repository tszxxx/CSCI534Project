there be place I will remember all my life , though some have change some forever not for better some have go and some remain all these place have they moment with lover and friend , I still can recall some be dead and some be live in my life , I have love they all but of all these friend and lover there be no one compare with you and these memory lose they mean when I think of love as something new though I know I will never lose affection for people and thing that go before I know I will often stop and think about they in my life , I love you more though I know I will never lose affection for people and thing that go before I know I will often stop and think about they in my life , I love you more ooh la la la la , in my life
