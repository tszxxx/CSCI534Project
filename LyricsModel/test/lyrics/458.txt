[Intro]
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
[Verse 1]
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
[Verse 2]
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
[Verse 3]
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be
[Verse 4]
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
