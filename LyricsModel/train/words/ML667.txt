late one night I Heard a knock on my door 
to know surprise it be my landlord 
he notify I I be late with the rent 
what can ya do with you last dollar spend 
ya get trouble some kind of trouble 
I call up my baby for a little advice 
because my sugar Baby always treat I so Nice 
I have a funny feel he be not alone 
when i Heard another voice whisper hang up the phone 
I get trouble some kind of trouble 
trouble in my heart trouble on my mind never any trouble for I to find some kind of trouble 
I go to my boss Said I need I Little Time 
to work on this poor broken heart of mine 
he Said I would like to help ya I have be they before but the problem be girl 
ya do not work here no more 
ya get trouble some kind of trouble 
trouble in my heart trouble on my mind never any trouble for I to find some kind of trouble 
I get trouble 
well I be down around as low as a body can be 
so I talk to my preacher about pray for I 
he smil and he say child you not alone 
because all god child get to deal with they own trouble 
some kind of trouble 
trouble in my heart trouble on my mind never any trouble for I to find some kind of trouble 
some kind of trouble

trouble in my heart trouble on my mind never any trouble for I to find some kind of trouble
