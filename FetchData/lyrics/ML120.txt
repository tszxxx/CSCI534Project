[Hook]
Walking on walking on broken glass
Walking on walking on broken glass
[Verse 1]
You were the sweetest thing
That I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar honey
If I can't have you
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass
[Hook]
Walking on walking on broken glass
Walking on walking on broken glass
[Verse 2]
The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Oh let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass
[Hook]
Walking on walking on broken glass
[Bridge]
And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well my dear
[Verse 3]
Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass
[Hook]
Walking on walking on broken glass
Walking on walking on broken glass
Walking on walking on broken glass
Walking on walking on broken glass
Walking on walking on broken glass
