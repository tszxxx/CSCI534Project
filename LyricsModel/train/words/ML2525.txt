do you do you want to bleed 
do you do you want to live in vain 
it be only life 
she be so afraid to kiss 
and so afraid to laugh 
be she run from she past 
it be only life 
she be so afraid of love 
be so afraid of hate 
what be she run from now 
do you do you want to scream 
do you do you want to face the strange 
do you do you believe 
be you be you afraid of change 
it be only life 
she be so afraid of this 
and so afraid to ask 
she hide behind she mask 
nothing be ever right 
she be so afraid of pain 
so afraid of blame 
it be drive she insane 
so insecure 
there be no cure 
well she be so afraid 
she be so afraid of death 
she be so afraid afraid of life 
the drama in she head 
get louder all the time 
get louder all the time 
she be so afraid afraid to lose 
be so afraid of fame 
everyday she feel the same 
it be drive she insane 
it be drive she 
it be drive 
it be 
another broken pretty thing
