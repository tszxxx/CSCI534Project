I have see God in the sun I have see God in the street God before bed and the promise of sleep God in my dream and the free ride of grace but it all disappear and then I wake up be it too late ? be it just you fate ? there 's a demon that wait at the garden gate if you get past he maybe Lawrence and phil will be wait to take you to the ghost of rockschool everything hum as the blue heart turn and the blue girl dawn we when the sun go down a story tonight be from you solitude height I get a window on you constellation master I love from the ground above there 's the star below as my memory flow every picture frame be beat louder than time every clock in the hall be bend slowly she 's in she tower and she 's beautiful , sure the quicker you learn she have no soul to discern at least no business of yours you bear the vacuum of scar she be put there to tempt you like the perfume of flower I have see God in the sun I have see God in the street God before bed and the promise of sleep God in my dream and the free ride of grace I have see God shine up from she reflection I have see God in the sun I have see God in the street God before bed and the promise of sleep God in the puddle and the lane beside she I have see God shine up from she reflection
