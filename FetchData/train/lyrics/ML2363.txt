The telepromter is read by the telegenic
Dead and it goes out across the nation there
Ain't no war information
The bravest kids I know are the ones that
Got to go fishing over there
All channels pre emptied another socialite
Is gonna get arrested pop-culture transaction
Takin' over my television
The bravest kids I know are the ones that
Got to go fishing over there
