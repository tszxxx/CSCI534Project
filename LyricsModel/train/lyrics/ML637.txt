I'm making my decision, yeah
Every time I hear the music
And I make a dip, a dip
Slave master comes around
And spanks us with his whip, the whip
But if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the plantations on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
'Cause every time we do the work
Sometimes we are hurt, oh yeah
Boss never do a thing
But hold on to his girth
But if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the plantations on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
Every time I hear the music
And I move my hip, my hip
Slave master comes around
And spanks us with his whip, a whip
Slave master
I'm the shepherd, you're my pastor
Said you work in this corner
So long you make me work
'Cause if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the stations on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
Slave master
I'm the shepherd, you're my pastor
Said you work in this corner
So long you make me work
