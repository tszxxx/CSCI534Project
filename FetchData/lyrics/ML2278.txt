[Verse 1]
Blacktop letters written out in chalk
That she might see me when school is over
Dripping thoughts fall onto your sidewalk
I could only tell you when I'm not sober
[Chorus]
It's not your fault
[Verse 2]
Cryptic message written in the dark
All that haunts me is surely closure
Locking hands floating through the park
They always watch me losing composure
[Chorus]
It's not your fault
