I've never been too good with names
The cellar door was open, I could never stay away
I know it's prob'ly not my place
It's either or, I'm hoping for a simple way to say
It's a shame about Ray
In the stone, under the dust
His name is still engraved
Some things need to go away
It's a shame about Ray
If I make it through today
I'll know tomorrow not to leave my feelings out on display
I'll put the cobwebs back in place
I've never been too good with names
But I remember faces
