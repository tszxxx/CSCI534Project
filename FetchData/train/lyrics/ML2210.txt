[Verse 1]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
And when those blue melodies start calling
[Chorus]
You'll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
[Verse 2]
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, if you're not here with me
I'll have a Blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurting
[Chorus]
You'll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
