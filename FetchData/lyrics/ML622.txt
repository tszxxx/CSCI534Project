The Majors â€“ A Wonderful Dream
Last night I had a wonderful dream about you (dream about you)
Last night I had a dream; hope that it will come true
Last night I had (sho-bop, sho-bop) a wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)
I dreamed I held you in my arms
And you thrilled me with your charms
In a wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream) I had last night (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)
Your lips were, oh, so soft and warm
And a wonderful love (sho-bop, sho-bop) was born (love was born)
We were all alone, you told me that you care (told me that you care)
And I never will forget how happy I was that we were there
Last night I had (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream) a wonderful dream
(sho-bop, sho-bop a wonderful dream)
And now that I'm alone with you
My wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop) will come true (sho-bop, sho-bop a wonderful dream; sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)
Last night I had a wonderful dream about you (dream about you)
Last night I had a dream; hope that it will come true
(Sax solo)
Ooo, we were all alone, you told me that you care (told me that you care)
And I never will forget how happy I was that we were there
Last night I had (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream) a wonderful dream
(sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)
And now that I'm alone with you
My wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop) will come true (sho-bop, sho-bop a wonderful dream)
Please come true, (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream) a wonderful, wonderful dream
(sho-bop, sho-bop a wonderful dream)
