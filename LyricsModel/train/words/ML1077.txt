I use to cry myself to sleep at night 
but that be all before he come 
I think love have to hurt to turn out right 
but now he be here 
it be not the same it be not the same 
he fill I up 
he give I love 
more love than I have ever see 
he be all I have get 
he be all I have get in this world 
but he be all the man that I need 
and in the morning when I kiss he eye 
he take I down and rock I slow 
and in the evening 
when the moon be high 
he hold I close and will not let go 
he will not let go 
he fill I up 
he give I love 
more love than I have ever see 
he be all I have get 
he be all I have get in this world 
but he be all the man that I need 
he fill I up 
he give I love 
more love than I have ever see 
he be all I have get 
he be all I have get in this world 
but he be all the man that I need 
he fill I up 
he give I love 
more love than I have ever see 
he be all I have get 
he be all I have get in this world 
but he be all the man that I need
