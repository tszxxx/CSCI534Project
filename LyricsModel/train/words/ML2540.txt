this song to all the people 
with light in they heart 
and love in they eye 
you do not have to worry 
when the mountain seem of infinite size 
there be one who go before you to calm the sea 
there be a king who lead he people to victory 
we be destine to win 
we be surround by he love 
and guard by he power 
destine to win 
follow the Lord until the battle over 
we be destine to win 
we all get discourage 
when the pressure of life start weigh we down 
we have learn that in he footstep 
cross in life must preceed the crown 
there be one who go before you 
to calm the sea 
there be a king who lead he people to victory 
we be destine to win 
we be surround by he love 
and guard by he power 
destine to win 
follow the Lord until the battle over 
we be destine to win 
we have get to remember 
it be we destiny to win the end 
with Christ on we side 
we be destine to win 
we be destine to win 
we be surround by he love 
and guard by he power 
destine to win 
follow the Lord until the battle over 
destine to win 
we be surround by he love 
and guard by he power 
destine to win 
follow the Lord until the battle over 
we be destine 
we be destine 
we be destine to win
