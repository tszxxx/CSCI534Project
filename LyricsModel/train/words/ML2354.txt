everything i do make she sad 
if i say i love she then it just make she mad 
nothing i can do will make she love I too 
everything i do make she sad 
everything i do make she cry oh my 
it just break my heart in two when i hear she sigh 
there be nothing worse than to know she hurt 
everything i do make she cry 
call it love 
call it pain 
call it all insane 
love be blind 
love be cruel 
love be fine for fool 
everything i do make she sad 
I could understand it if i treat she bad 
but i remind she of some unhappy love 
can not replace the love that she have 
so everything i do everything i do 
everything i do make she sad
