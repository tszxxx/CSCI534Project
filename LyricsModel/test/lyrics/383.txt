Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Gotta hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I got me a date with a pretty little girl from Greece
She promised she'd be there with me
Oh, the hours we'd spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and a-wasting time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard drive
Train wheels are running through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday everything is gonna sound like a rhapsody
Sailing 'round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola
Well, I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergy men in uniform and young girls pulling mussels
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspaper men eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
But someday every thing's gonna be different
When I paint that masterpiece
