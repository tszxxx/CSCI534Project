take back the holly and mistletoe 
silver bell on a string 
if I write a letter to Santa Claus 
I would ask for just one thing 
I do not need sleigh ride in the snow 
I do not want a Christmas that be blue 
take back the tinsel stocking and bow 
cuz all I want for Christmas be you 
I do not need expensive thing 
they do not matter to I 
what I want can not be find 
underneath the Christmas tree 
you be the angel that top my tree 
you be my dream come true 
Santa can not bring I what I need 
cuz all I want for Christmas be you 
I do not need expensive thing 
they do not matter to I 
what I want can not be find 
underneath the Christmas tree 
you be the angel that top my tree 
you be my dream come true 
Santa can not bring I what I need 
cuz all I want for Christmas be you 
all I want for Christmas be you
