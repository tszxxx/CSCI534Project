[Verse 1]
I remember long ago
How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards
Cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window
[Chorus]
California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye
[Verse 2]
Land of beauty
Space and light
Land of promise
Land of might
You're my home now
And it's true
California, here's to you
[Chorus]
California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye
[Outro]
The golden state!
