Oh no You drive me crazy You do
Don't you know, know, know
What you're doin' to me?
Only you drive me wild
You're my ecstasy
Can't you tell by the look in my eyes
That I love you? oh
I've gotta show you what I feel in my heart
'Cause I knew it right from the start
That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with all of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside and it's all over you
I'm mad about you
Don't ya go, go, go
Too far away
I need you close by my side
Always here to stay
Can't you tell by the look in my eyes
That I love you? Ohh
I've gotta show you what I feel in my heart
'Cause I knew it right from the start
That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with all of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside and it's all about you
It's been a long time baby
Ooh I keep this brewin' inside
I can't take any more
Oh girl, I'm mad about you
