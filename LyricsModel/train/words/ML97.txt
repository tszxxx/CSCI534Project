well I have hear lot of people say 
they be go to settle down 
you do not see they face 
and they do not come around 
well I be not that way 
I get to move along 
I like to drink and to dance all night 
come to a fix not afraid to fight 
you get that right 
Said you get that right 
sure get that right 
seem so long I be out on my own 
travel light and I be always alone 
guess I be bear with a travellin bone 
when my time up I will hold my own 
you will not find I in a old folk home 
you get that right 
Said you get that right 
well you get that right 
sure get that right 
I try everything in my life 
thing I like I try them twice 
travel around the world just sing my song 
I get to go Lord I can not stay long 
here come that ol travelling jone once again 
I like to drink and to dance all night 
come to a fix not afraid to fight
