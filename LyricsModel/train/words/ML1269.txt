we have take too much for grant 
and all the time it have grow 
from techno seed we first plant 
evolve a mind of its own 
march in the street 
drag iron foot 
laser beaming heart 
rip man apart 
from off I have see my perfection 
where we could do as we please 
in secrecy this infection 
be spread like a disease 
hide underground 
know we would be find 
fear for we life 
reap by robot 's scythes 
Metal god 
Metal god 
Metal god 
Metal god 
machine be take all over 
with mankind in they command 
in time they would like to discover 
how they can make they demand 
better be the slave 
to they wicked way 
but meet with we death 
engulf in molten breath
