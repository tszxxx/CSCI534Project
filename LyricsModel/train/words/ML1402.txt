when we laugh indoors the blissful tone bounce off the wall and fall to the ground 
peel the hardwood back to let they loose from decade trap and listen so still 
this city be my home construction noise all day long 
and gutter punk be bum change 
so I breed thicker skin and let my lustrous coat fill in 
and I will never admit that I love you Guinevere 
I love you Guinevere 
I love you 
I have always fall fast with too much trust in the promise that 
no one be ever be here so you can quell those wet fear 
I want purity I must have it here right now 
but do not you get I start now 
December 's chill come late the day get darker and we wait for this direness to pass 
there be pile on the floor of artifact from dresser drawer and I will help you pack 
I love you Guinevere 
I love you Guinevere 
I love you
