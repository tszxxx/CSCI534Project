yesterday the sky be cold and grey 
keep I as a prisoner in my home 
Ground through my door when I be all alone 
scowle down on I laugh with the Sun 
as he hide himself from darkness from everyone 
the sky sometimes so unkind first he rain and then he shine 
when he smile on my face he cloud all seem so out of place 
when he smile on my face he cloud all seem so out of place 
I will love you till the sky above you shatter over you and I 
and lay we down to sleep forever la la la la 
the sky today be brilliant and blue 
brighten up the walkway to my door 
bring you as a sunbeam on my floor 
beam you down on I from the other side 
bring you up to I across the ocean wide 
the sky sometimes so unkind then again heâ€™s my best friend 
when he smile on my face he cloud all seem so out of place 
when he smile on my face he cloud all seem so out of place 
I will love you till the sky above you shatter over you and I 
and lay we down to sleep forever la la la la la la la 
sleep forever la la la la la la la 
sleep forever la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
