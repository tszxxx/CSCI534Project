[Verse 1]
Honey, you're so fine
I wanna be with you all of the time
I couldn't tell you just how much I loved you
But now that you're all mine, I'll tell you all the time
[Verse 2]
Honey, you're so sweet
I wanna be with you every week
I couldn't tell you just how much I loved you
But now that you're mine, I'll tell you all the time
[Chorus]
Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey
[Verse 3]
You're so good to me when you go away
But when you get home you don't have much to say
It doesn't matter to me either way
All I want is for you to stay
[Chorus]
Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey
