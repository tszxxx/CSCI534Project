[Chorus](x6)
Lie, lie, lie
[Verse 1]
The full moon is rising over dark water
And the fools below are picking up sticks
And the man in the gallows
Lies permanently waiting for the doctors
To come back and tend to him
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The Flat earth society is meeting here today
Singing happy little lies
And the Bright Ship Humana
Is sailing far away
With grave determination...
And no destination!
[Chorus](x6)
Lie, lie, lie
[Verse 2]
Nothing Feels better than a spray of clean water
And the whistling wind
On a calm summer night
But you'd better believe that down in their quarters
The men are holding on for their dear lives
[Pre-Chorus 2]
The flat earth society is somewhere far away, with their candlesticks and compasses
And the Bright Ship Humana
Is well on it's way with grave determination...
And no destination!
[solo]
[Pre-Chorus 3]
The flat earth society is meeting here today
Singing happy little lies
And the Bright Ship Humana
Is well on it's way with grave determination...
And no destination!
[Chorus](ad infinitum)
Lie, lie, lie
