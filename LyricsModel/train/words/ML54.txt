planting seed of hate 
I have love turn to hate 
trap far beyond my fate 
I give you take 
this life that I forsake 
be cheat of my youth 
you have turn this lie to truth 
anger misery 
you will suffer unto I 
harvester of sorrow 
harvester of sorrow 
pure black look clear

try get back to I 
get back which use to be 
drink up shoot in 
let the beating begin 
distributor of pain 
you loss become my gain 
anger misery

harvester of sorrow 
harvester of sorrow 
all have say they prayer 
invade they nightmare 
to see into my eye 
you will find where murder lie 
infanticide 
harvester of sorrow
