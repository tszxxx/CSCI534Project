[Verse]
Christmas future is far away, Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today bringing joy that may last
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, may your heart be light
In a year our troubles will be out of sight
From now on, have yourself a merry little Christmas, make the yuletide gay
In a year our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days, happy golden days of yore
Precious friends who are dear to us gather near to us once more
I know that in a year we all will be together, if the Fates allow
Until then, we'll just have to muddle through somehow
And have ourselves a merry little Christmas now
[Outro]
Cause everybody knows
