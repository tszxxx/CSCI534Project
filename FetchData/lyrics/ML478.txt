[Verse 1]
Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key
[Chorus]
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home
[Verse 2]
Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key
[Chorus]
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home
[Outro]
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
And I've done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home
