[Verse]
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up, oh yes
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
But we couldn't stay there
And got up
Sing now
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
But we couldn't stay there
And got up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
And got up
Everybody sing now
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
But we couldn't stay there
And got up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
And got up
[Bridge]
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
And got up
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
And got up
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
And got up
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
[Outro]
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
And got up
