last night we go to bed not talk 
cause we would already say too much 
I face the wall you face the window 
bound and determined not to touch 
we have be marry seven year now 
some day it feel like 21 
I be still mad at you this morning 
coffee be ready if you want some 
I have be up since five 
think about I and you 
and I have get to tell you 
the conclusion I have come to 
I will never leave I will never stray 
my love for you will never change 
but I be not ready to make up or get around to that 
I think I be right I think you be wrong 
I will probably give in before long 
please do not make I smile 
I just want to be mad for a while 
for now you might as well forget it 
do not run you finger through my hair 
yeah that be right I be be stubborn 
no I do not want to go back upstairs 
I be go to leave for work 
without a goodbye kiss 
but as I be drive off 
just remember this 
I will never leave I will never stray 
my love for you will never change 
but I be not ready to make up or get around to that 
I think I be right I think you be wrong 
I will probably give in before long 
please do not make I smile 
I just want to be mad for a while 
I will never leave I will never stray 
my love for you will never change 
but I be not ready to make up or get around to that 
I think I be right I think you be wrong 
I will probably give in before long 
please do not make I smile 
I just want to be mad for a while 
I just want to be mad for a while 
I just want to be mad for a while 
I just want to be mad for a while
