still by the window pane 
pain like the rain that be fall 
she wait in the air Matte Kudasai 
she sleep in a chair in she sad America 
when when be a night so long 
long like the note I be send 
she wait in the air Matte Kudasai 
she sleep in a chair in she sad America 
she wait in the air Matte Kudasai 
she sleep in a chair in she sad America
