I will not stand in you way 
let you hatred grow 
and she will scream and she will shout and she will pray 
and she have a name yeah she have a name 
I will not hold you back 
let you anger rise 
and we will fly and we will fall and we will burn 
no one will recall no one will recall 
this be the last time I will abandon you 
and this be the last time I will forget you 
I wish I could 
look to the star 
let hope burn in you eye 
and we will love and we will hate and we will die 
all to no avail all to no avail 
this be the last time I will abandon you 
and this be the last time I will forget you 
I wish I could 
this be the last time I will abandon you 
and this be the last time I will forget you 
I wish I could 
I wish I could
