Lord I be five hundred mile away from home 
teardrop fall on mama 's note when I read the thing she write 
she say we miss you son we love you come on home 
well I do not have to pack I have it all right on my back 
now I be five hundred mile away from home 
away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone 
yes I be five hundred mile away from home 
I know this be the same road I take the day I leave home 
but it sure look different now 
well I guess I look different too cause time change everything 
I wonder what they will say when they see they boy look this way 
oh I wonder what they will say when I get home 
can not remember when I eat it be just thumb and walk and wait 
and I be still five hundred mile away from home 
if my luck have be just right I would be with they all tonight 
but I be still five hundred mile away from home 
away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone 
yes I be five hundred mile away from home 
Lord I be still five hundred mile away from home
