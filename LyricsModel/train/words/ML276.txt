there be thunder in he footstep 
and lightn in he fist 
and the Lord be not joke

and so you better be believe that

with wisdom power and love

we God be a awesome God 
he reign from heaven above 
with wisdom power and love

and when the sky be starless 
in the void of the night 
he speak into the darkness 
and create the light 
judgement and wrath 
he pour out on Sodom 
Mercy and grace 
he give we at the cross 
I hope that we have not 
too quickly forget that
