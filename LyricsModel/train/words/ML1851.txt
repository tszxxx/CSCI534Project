a heart of stone a smoking gun 
I can give you life I can take it away 
a heart of stone a smoking gun 
I be work it out 
why would you feel so underrated 
why would you feel so negate 
turn away from the light become adult 
turn into myself 
I want to bite not destroy to feel she underneath 
turn into the light 
she do not think straight 
no no no she do not think straight 
she be get such a dirty mind and it never ever stop 
and you do not taste like she and you never ever will 
and we do not read the papers we do not read the news 
Heaven be never enough we will never be fool 
turn away from the light become adult 
turn into myself 
I want to bite not destroy to feel she underneath 
turn into the light 
and if you feel 
a little leave behind 
we will wait for you on the other side 
and if you feel 
a little leave behind 
we will wait for you on the other side 
cause I be on fire 
cause you know I be on fire when you come 
cause you know I be on fire 
cause you know I be on fire so stomp I out 
cause I be on fire 
cause I be on fire 
cause I be on fire 
cause I be on fire
