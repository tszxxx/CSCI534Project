there be sap in the tree if you tap them 
there be blood on the seas if you map hath m 
christian if you see you papa tell he I love he 
he teach I to love in the wild and fight in the gym 
he teach I the bottle give birth to the cup 
and you will not get hurt if you just keep you hand up 
and stand tall like sycamore 
Sycamore get to grow down to grow up 
young root takl the soil like baby 's first cup 
and when they bend you in two 
and say too green for the fire 
when all you want to do be be a part of the fire 
all you want to do be be the fire part of fire 
like sycamore 
there be sap in the tree if you tap them 
there be blood on the seas if you map hath m 
christian when I see you papa I will tell he you love he 
and remember to love in the wild and fight in the gym 
remember the bottle give birth to the cup 
and you will not get hurt if you just keep you hand up 
and stand tall like sycamore
