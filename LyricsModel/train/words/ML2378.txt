make a lovely light 
but not as bright as you eye tonight 
blow out the candle 
make you wish come true 
for I will be wish 
that you love I too

but you be my teenage queen 
you be the prettiest loveliest girl I have ever see

in my heart will glow 
for ever and ever for I love you so 
you be only sixteen 
but you be my teenage queen 
oh you be the prettiest loveliest girl I have ever see 
sixteen candle 
in my heart will glow 
for ever and ever 
for I love you so
