you see thing 
and have epiphany 
I run away 
scared of what you will say 
the smoke billowing 
you say thing 
and have epiphany 
I lie awake 
scared of what I will say 
the smoke billowing 
from my eye to yours 
from my mind to yours 
everything you say to I 
be swish in my head 
like a bullet in my head
