[Verse 1]
I had to fix a lot of things this morning
Because they were so scrambled
But now it's okay
I tell you I've got enough to do
The afternoon was filled up with phone calls
What a hot sticky day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The air is cooling down
[Chorus 1]
Take all the time you need, it's a lovely night
If you decide to come, you're going to do it right
Drive for a couple miles, you see a sign and turn
Left for a couple blocks, next is mine you'll turn
Left on a little road, it's a bumpy one
You see a white fence, move the gate and drive
Through on the left side, come right in and you'll
Find me in my house somewhere
Keeping busy while I wait
[Verse 2]
I get a lot of thoughts in the morning
I write them all down
If it wasn't for that
I'd forget them in a while
And lately I've been thinking about a good friend
I'd like to see more of
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I'll make a call
[Chorus 2]
I wrote a number down but I lost it
So I searched through my pocket book, I couldn't find it
So I sat and concentrated on the number and
Slowly it came to me so I dialed it
And I let it ring a few times, there was no answer
[Outro]
So I let it ring a little more, still no answer
So I hung up the telephone, got some paper and
Sharpened up a pencil and
Wrote a letter to my friend
