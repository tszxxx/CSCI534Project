I be not in love 
but I be open to persuasion 
East or West 
where be the best 
for romancing 
with a friend 
I can smile 
but with a lover 
I could hold my head back 
I could really laugh 
really laugh 
thank you 
you take I dancing 
Cross the floor 
cheek to cheek 
but with a lover 
I could really move 
really move 
I could really dance 
really dance 
really dance 
really dance 
I could really move 
really move 
really move 
really move 
now if I can feel the sun 
in my eye 
and the rain on my face 
why can not I 
feel love 
really love 
really love 
really love 
really love 
really love 
love love love love 
love love love love 
now I get all 
the friend that I want 
I may need more 
but I shall just stick to those 
that I have get 
with friend I still feel 
so insecure 
little darling I believe you could 
help I a lot 
just take my hand 
and lead I where you will 
no conversation 
no wave goodnight 
just make love 
with affection 
sing I another love song 
but this time 
with a little dedication 
sing it sing it 
you know that be what I like 
once more with feeling 
give I love 
give I love 
give I love

love uh hu 
make love with affection 
sing I another love song 
but this time with a little dedication 
sing it sing it sing it sing it 
you know that be what I like

once more with the feeling 
sing I another love song 
but this time with a little dedication 
sing it sing it sing it sing it 
you know that be what I like 
love uh hu 
with affection 
with a little dedication 
once more with the feeling 
you know that be what I like
