I can hear you sigh 
say you will stay beside I 
why must it be 
that you always creep 
into my dream 
on the beach we be sit 
hugging squeeze kissing 
why must it be 
that you always creep 
into my dream 
in my dream 
when I be sleep at night baby 
I feel those moment of ecstasy 
when you sleep at night baby 
I wonder do I creep into you dream 
or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy 
oh love be so amazing 
oh oh oh ah ah 
guess you will be stay 
so let it be 
that you always creep 
into my dream 
in my dream 
when I be sleep at night baby 
I feel those moment of ecstasy 
when you sleep at night baby 
I wonder do I creep into you dream 
or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy 
oh love be so amazing 
oh oh oh ah ah 
guess you will be stay 
so let it be 
that you always creep 
into my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream 
in my dream
