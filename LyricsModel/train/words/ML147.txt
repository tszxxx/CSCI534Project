we walk the loneliest mile we smile without any style we kiss altogether wrong no intention we lie about each other 's drink we live without each other think what anyone would do without I and you it 's like I tell you only the lonely can play so hold on , here we go hold on to nothing we know I feel so lonely Way up here you mention the time we be together so long ago well , I do not remember all I know be that it make I feel good now it 's like I tell you only the lonely can play only the lonely only the lonely can play only the lonely only the lonely can play it 's like I tell you only the lonely can play only the lonely only the lonely can play
