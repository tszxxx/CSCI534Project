[Verse 1:]
There’s a light that cannot shine
Until you come into my life
And love reveals you will be the one
The one for me
And I’ll give you all I have to give
All the love
All the joy
My heart can give
Hoping you will share the same with me
[Chorus:]
(Come share my love)
Come share my love
(Come on share my love)
(Come share my joy)
Come share my joy
(Come share my joy)
(Come share my joy)
Come share my love
Won’t you come share with me?
Pretty baby
Come into my life
Share my love
[Verse 2:]
There’s a peak on every mountain
A shore for every sea
It’s hard to understand
Were you meant for me?
There’s an answer to the question
But there’s no guarantee
And I’ll give you all I have to give
All the love
All the joy my heart can give
Hoping you will share the same with me
Ooh, hoo
[Chorus:]
(Come share my love)
Come share my love
(Come on, share my love)
(Come share my joy)
Come share my joy
(Come share my joy)
(Come share my joy)
Come share my love
Won’t you come share with me?
Pretty baby
Come into my life
Share my love
Oh
(Come share my love)
Share my love
Won’t you share my love?
(Come share my joy)
Won’t you come on and share my joy?
(Come share my love)
Share my love
Share my love
(Come share my joy)
Share my, my joy
(Come share my love)
(Come share my joy)
Come on and share my joy
(Come share my love)
Come on share my love
(Come share my joy)
Won’t you come on and share my joy?
(Come share my love)
Come share
(Come share my joy)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my love
Come on, baby
(Come share my love)
Share, share my love
(Come share my joy)
Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
(Come share my love)
(Come share my joy)
(Come share my love)
Come on, baby
Share my love
(Come share my joy)
Ooh, ooh
Come on, baby
(Come share my love)
Share my love
(Come share my joy)
Share my, my, my, my, my joy
Come on
(Come share my love)
(Come share my joy)
