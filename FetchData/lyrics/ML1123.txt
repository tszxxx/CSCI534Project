(That's how I escaped my certain fate)
This might be your only chance
To prove it on your own
Tulsa's not that
Tulsa's not that far
Besides if you stay
I'd feel a certain guilt
Did I hold you
Did I hold you back?
Can I count on you
If I fall apart?
Yeah, if I fall a
If I fall apart
That's how I escaped my certain fate
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Innocence a novice's mistake
That's how I escaped my certain fate
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Honesty's an actor's worst mistake
That's how I escaped my certain fate
