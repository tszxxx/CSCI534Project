I do not know how I survive in this cold and empty world for all this time I only know that I be alive because you love I when I recall what I have be through there 's some thing that I wish I do not do now I do the thing I do because you love I and now that you be in my life , I be so glad I be alive ' cause you show I the way and I know now how good it can be because you love I oh , and now that you be in my life oh , I be so glad I be alive ' cause you show I the way and I know now how good it can be because you love I I believe in thing unseen I believe in the message of a dream and I believe in what you be because you love I with all my heart and all my soul I be loving you and I never will let go and every day I will let it show because you love I because you love I ooh , because you love I
