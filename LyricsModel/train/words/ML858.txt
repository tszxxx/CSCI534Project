they say in chess you have get to 
kill the queen and then you have make it 
oh I do you 
a funny thing the king that 
get himself assassinate 
hey now every time I lose altitude 
you take a town by storm 
the mess you make be nominate 
oh I do you 
now put away you welcome 
soon you will find you have overstay it 
hey now every time I lose altitude 
so divine hell of a elevator 
all the while my fortune fade 
never mind the consequence of the crime 
this time my fortune fade 
the medicate state of mind you have find be overrated 
oh I do you 
you see it all come down and now it be time to imitate it 
hey now every time I lose altitude 
so divine hell of a elevator 
all the while my fortune fade 
never mind the consequence of the crime 
this time my fortune fade 
come on God do I seem bulletproof 
so divine hell of a elevator 
all the while my fortune fade 
never mind the consequence of the crime 
this time my fortune fade 
so divine hell of a elevator 
all the while my fortune fade 
never mind the consequence of the crime 
this time my fortune fade
