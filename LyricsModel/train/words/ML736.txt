Alabama Arkansas I do love my ma and Pa 
not the way that I do love you

the apple of my eye 
girl I never love one like you 
man oh man you be my best friend I scream it to the nothingness 
there be not nothing that I need 
hot and heavy pumpkin pie chocolate candy Jesus Christ 
be not nothing please I more than you 
oh home let I come home 
home be whenever I be with you 
oh home let I come home

La la la la take I home

I will follow you into the park through the jungle through the dark 
girl I never love one like you 
moat and boat and waterfall alleyway and pay phone call 
I be everywhere with you 
laugh until we think 
we will die 
barefoot on a summ 
er night 
never could be sweeter than with you 
and in the street you run afree like it be only you 
and I 
geeze you be something to see 
oh home let I come home 
home be whenever I be with you 
oh home let I come home 
home be wherever I be with you 
La la la la take I home 
Daddy I be come home

Jade 
Alexander 
do you remember that day you fall out of my window 
I sure do â€ you come jump out after I 
well you fall on the concrete and nearly break you ass you be bleed all over the place I rush you out to the hospital you remember that 
yes I do 
well there be something I never tell you about that night 
what do not you tell I 
while you be sit in the back seat smoke a cigarette you think be go to be you last I be fall deep deeply in love with you and I never tell you till just now 
aww 
oh home let I come home 
home be whenever I be with you 
oh home let I come home 
home be where I be alone with you 
outro Jade &amp 
Alexander 

Home let I come home 
home be wherever I be with you 
Home yes I be home 
home be when I be alone with you 
Alabama Arkansas 
I do love my ma and Pa 
moat and boat and waterfall 
alleyway and payphone call 
Home 
Home 
home be wherever I be with you 
Home 
Home 
home be wherever I be with you
