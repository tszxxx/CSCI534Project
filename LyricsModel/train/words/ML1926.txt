death be just a door Blake say it first 
it be just another room we enter it be the threshold that hurt 
birth be just a chorus death be just a verse 
in the great song of spring that the mockingbird sing 
we come and we go a-weep and a-wail we head in the hand of the nurse 
put you head on my shoulder baby tell I where it hurt 
you say you lose you one and only could it get any worse 
I say death be just a door you will be reunit on the other side 
birth be just a chorus death be just a verse 
in the great song of spring that the mockingbird sing 
we come and we go a-weep and a-wail we head in the hand of the nurse 
well put you head on my shoulder baby tell I where it hurt 
you say you lose you one and only could it get any worse 
I say death be just a door you will be reunit on the other side 
yeah death be just a door 
you will be reunit on the other side 
yeah death be just a door 
you will be reunit by and by
