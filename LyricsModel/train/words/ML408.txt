pardon I you leave you tear on the jukebox 
and I be afraid they get mix up with mine 
I do not mean to pry 
it be just that I notice you go out of you mind 
look like we be two of a kind 
let 's fall to piece together 
why should we both fall apart 
let 's fall to piece together 
right here in each other 's arm 
alone be much better together 
and the worst be still yet to come 
so let 's share the rest of the tear 
that be leave from two heart that just come undone 
why should we go crazy alone 
let 's fall to piece together 
right here in each other 's arm
