when I look up from my pillow 
I dream you be there with I 
though you be far away 
I know you will always be near to I 
I go to sleep 
and imagine that you be there with I 
I go to sleep 
and imagine that you be there with I 
I look around I and feel 
you be ever so close to I 
each tear that fall from my eye 
bring back memory of you to I 
I go to sleep 
and imagine that you be there with I 
I go to sleep 
and imagine that you be there with I 
I be wrong I will cry 
I will love you till the day I die 
you alone you alone and no one else 
you be mean for I 
oh 
when morning come again 
I have the loneliness you leave I 
each day drag by until finally 
my time descend on I 
I go to sleep 
and imagine that you be there with I 
I go to sleep 
and imagine that you be there with I
