can not find the answer 
I have be crawl on my knee 
look for anything 
to keep I from drowning 
promise have be turn to lie 
can not even be honest inside 
now I be run backwards 
watch my life wave I goodbye 
run blind 
I be run blind 
somebody help I see I be run blind 
search for nothing 
wonder if I will change 
I be try everything 
but everything still stay the same 
I think if I show you I could fly 
would not need anyone by my side 
I be go backwards 
with broken wing I know I will die 
run blind 
I be run blind 
somebody help I see I be run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
I can not find the answer 
I have be crawl on my knee 
look for anything 
to keep I from drowning 
I be run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind 
run blind
