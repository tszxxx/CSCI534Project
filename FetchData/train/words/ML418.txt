I rush home from work like I always do I spend my whole day just think of you when I walk through the front door my whole life be change cause nobody answer when I call you name a note on the table that tell I goodbye it say you would grow weary of live a lie you love have end but mine still remain but nobody answer when I call you name oh the lonely sound of my voice call be drive I insane and just like rain , the tear keep fall nobody answer when I call you name oh the lonely sound of my voice call be drive I insane and just like rain the tear keep fall nobody answer when I call you name oh nobody answer when I call you name
