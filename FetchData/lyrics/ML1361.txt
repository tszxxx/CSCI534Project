[Verse 1: Levi Little]
Can't forget the day
That you walked into my Life
It was just the kind of thing
That was so right on time
After all the love changes
My heart had locked the door
Then that girl released her magic
And made me love once more, ooh ooh hoo
[Pre-Chorus: Levi Little]
Like the warm rays of the sun
Her sweet love can shine down on me, oh-oh
All at once turned my life around
And with one kiss she set me free
[Chorus: Levi Little &amp; Blackstreet]
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy
[Verse 2: Levi Little]
Goodbye loneliness
And so long to my heartache
Now that Joy has taken over
And decided to stay
Her love lifts me up
Like no other love before
With every beat of my heart
I'm hold-holding on, whoa-oh, hey hey
[Pre-Chorus: Levi Little]
Just look what she's done for me
She's erased all the sadness away, oh-oh
I could never repay the deed
'Cause she keeps lovin me more and more
[Chorus: Levi Little &amp; Blackstreet]
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
And she brings me Joy
She's giving me...
[Bridge: Teddy Riley &amp; (Levi Little)]
Check one, check two
Can't hold back I'm in love with you
Check one, check two
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do for you
(I love, I love you)
Check one, check two
I can't hold back I'm in love with you
Check one, check two
There's nothing in the world that I would'nt do for you
[Chorus: Levi Little &amp; Blackstreet]
That girl she's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
(I love the way she loves me)
She brings me Joy
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
(A little bit of lovin' darling)
