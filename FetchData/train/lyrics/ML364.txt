Well I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot that I dont regret
Then I hung around till you said I do
I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Well it changed my thinking when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
If I didn't have you I'd long ago been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowing around from town to town like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you I know I'd be foundering around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane and that's where I'd have been
But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Well I count my blessings every night I pray
That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day He does 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
If I didn't have you I'd long ago been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowing around from town to town like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you I know I'd be floundering around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane and that's where I'd have been
But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Well I've already said it but I swear it's true
I know I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
