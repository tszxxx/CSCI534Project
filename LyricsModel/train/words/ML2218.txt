I have be lonely too long I have be lonely too long 
in the past it be come and go I feel like I can not go on without 
love 
I have be lonely too long 
I have be lonely too long 
as I look back 
I can see I lose and search 
now I find that I can choose I be free oh yeah 
so funny I just have to laugh 
all my trouble be tear in half 
I be lonely too long 
Lonely too long 
in the past it be come and go 
I feel like I can not go on without love 
lonely too long 
I have be lonely too long 
just see I now 
make it worth the time I have wait 
she be all I need to make I see oh yeah 
I keep hopin with all my mind 
everything go to turn out right 
I have be lonely too long 
I have be lonely too long 
now look at I 
glide through this world of beauty 
everything I do bring ecstasy oh yeah 
no wonder I could die 
I feel like I be bout ten mile high 
I have be lonely too long 
Lonely too long 
find myself somebody 
do not have to be alone no more 
do not have to alone no more no more he be be lonely he be be 
Lonely
