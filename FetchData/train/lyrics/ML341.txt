[Intro]
Shiny happy people laughing
[Verse 1]
Meet me in the crowd, people, people
Throw your love around, love me, love me
Take it into town, happy, happy
Put it in the ground where the flowers grow
Gold and silver shine
[Chorus]
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing
[Verse 2]
Everyone around, love them, love them
Put it in your hands, take it, take it
There's no time to cry, happy, happy
Put it in your heart where tomorrow shines
Gold and silver shine
[Chorus]
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing
[Bridge]
Whoa, here we go
[Chorus]
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing
[Outro]
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
People, happy people
People
