Silent night holy night 
all be calm all be bright 
round yon virgin mother and child 
holy infant so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace 
sleep in heavenly peace 
Silent night holy night 
shepherd quake at the sight 
glory stream from heaven afar 
heavenly host sing Alleluia 
Christ the saviour be bear 
Christ the saviour be bear 
Silent night holy night 
all be calm all be bright 
round yon virgin mother and child 
holy infant so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace 
sleep in heavenly peace
