Now you're putting on the style
And you've never once looked back
At your home across the tracks
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down
They have changed you're attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath you're still the same
When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down
