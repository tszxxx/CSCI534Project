out on the back porch 
you say tonight 
we bring we pocket we pocket knife 
you want to fight I you want to fight 
forget sense of I 
say ah say ah 
and in the backyard 
into the night 
we walk through fire 
my love be you flashlight 
they want to fight I they want to fight 
forget sense of I 
say ah say ah oh 
walk through the fire 
walk till it get dark 
there be no hiding 
to save you life 
you have get to try 
say you be I now 
set you arm down 
say ah say ah 
say ah say ah 
say ah say ah
