[Verse 1]
Ain’t it strange
How everybody says I love you
Ain’t it a shame
How a word can't tell you more than words can say
I need you here
Ain’t it strange
‘Cause I’m always thinkin' of ya
Ain’t it a shame
How a thought can catch the breeze and blow away
I need you here
[Chorus]
Oh, but I know how bad it can get (How bad it can get)
But I don’t mind
Baby, I don’t mind (I, I don't mind)
But I know how soon you’ll forget me (Soon we'll forget)
But time keeps blaring
Baby, time takes care of me
[Verse 2]
Ain't it strange
How a man who lives for nothing can change
'Cause if he stays the same he’ll die a million days
Year by year
There’s a drain
At the bottom of the ocean
And when it rains
We'll get close to where the water meets the sky
For you and I
[Chorus]
Oh, but I don’t know how far this could go (Bad, bad it can get)
But I don't mind
Baby, I don't mind (I don't mind)
There's no use in sayin'
That you've been sprayin'
But even strangers know how strange it can be (in love)
[Bridge]
We're only getting old
'Cause that's what we are told to do
But they sang to get through
But what's that got to do with us?
So go on and work it out
[Instrumental]
