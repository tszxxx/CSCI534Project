it be so sad livin at home 
far from the city and the midnight fun 
it be so bad goin to school 
so far from I and the dirty thing that we have do 
I be the king of the night time world 
and you be my headlight queen 
I be the king of the night time world 
come live you secret dream 
it be so fine lovin with ease 
far from the house and the family fight 
it be so fine bein with you 
Bein with I make everything alright 
I be the king of the night time world 
and you be my headlight queen 
I be the king of the night time world 
come live you secret dream 
alright 
it be so sad you be not content 
far from the music and the neon glow 
be not you glad we get the time 
far from we folk they will never ever know 
I be the king of the night time world 
and you be my headlight queen 
I be the king of the night time world 
come live you secret dream 
I be the king I be the king I be the king I be the king 
I be the king I be the king I be the king I be the king 
I be the king of the night time world 
and you be my headlight queen 
I be the king of the night time world 
come live you secret dream 
I be the king of the night time world 
and you be my headlight queen 
I be the king of the night time world 
come live you secret dream 
I be the king of the night time world 
and you be my headlight queen 
I be the king of the night time world 
come live you secret dream
