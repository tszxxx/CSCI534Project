a thought that never change remain a stupid lie 
it be never be quite the same 
no hearing or breathing 
no movement no color just silence 
rise and fall of shame 
a search that shall remain 
we ask you what you would see 
you say you do not care 
sound form in a vacuum may seem a waste of time 
it be always be just the same 
no hearing or breathing 
no movement no lyric just nothing 
the sign that lead the way 
the path we can not take 
you have catch I at a bad time 
so why do not you piss off
