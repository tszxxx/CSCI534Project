they try to tell we we be too young 
too young to really be in love 
they say that love be a word 
a word we have only hear 
but can not begin to know the meaning of 
and yet we be not too young to know 
this love will last though year may go 
and then someday they may recall 
we be not too young at all 
and yet we be not too young to know 
this love will last though year may go 
and then someday they may recall 
we be not too young at all
