I be a man 
I be self aware 
and everywhere I go 
you be always right there with I 
I flirt with you all my life 
even kiss you once or twice 
and to this day I swear it be nice 
but clearly I be not ready 
when you touch a friend of mine 
I think I would lose my mind 
and I find out with time 
that really I be not ready no no 
oh death oh death oh death really I be not ready 
oh death 
you I 
decimate those dear to I 
tease I with you sweet release 
you be full and you be constant 
when my mom she be cancer sick 
she fight but then succumb to it 
but you make she beg for it 
sweet Jesus please I be ready 
oh death oh death oh death 
really I be not ready no no no 
I be not ready 
I be not ready 
no no 
oh death oh death 
really I be not ready
