the quiet kid be come to stay 
what do he say 
he say I be lonely 
say I be lonely 
I will tell you everything I know 
what do you know 
he say I be hopeless 
say I be hopeless 
and that be why I can not send you Christmas card 
it be why I have to keep you in the dark 
less big word and more exclamation mark 
the little king be lock away 
swallow the key 
he say it be alright 
but I be not sorry 
I will tell you everything I see 
what do you see 
a hundred and one 
he say it be alright 
but I know what I have do 
and that be why I can not send you Christmas card 
it be why I have to keep you in the dark 
less big word and so 
char but destroy 
open up the window 
bored and overwhelmed 
I be overwhelmed 
but that be the best part 
that be the best part 
cause I have be take you advice 
like a speak and spell 
and I could get to know you better 
and never know you well
