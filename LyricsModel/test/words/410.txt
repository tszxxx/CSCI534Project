I can not wait , wait for you to change you mind it 's late , I be try to walk the line well , it 's way past midnight and there be people all around some on they way up , some on they way down the air burn and I be try to think straight and I do not know how much longer I can wait I be you man , I be try to recover the sweet love that we know you understand that my heart can not go on beat without you well , you loveliness have wounded I , I be reel from the blow I wish I know what it be keep I loving you so I be breathing hard , stand at the gate but I do not know how much longer I can wait Skies be grey , I be look for anything that will bring a happy glow night or day , it do not matter where I go anymore , I just go if I ever see you come I do not know what I would do I 'o like to think I could control myself , but it be not true that 's how it be when thing disintegrate and I do not know how much longer I can wait I be doom to love you , I have be roll through stormy weather I be think of you and all the place we could roam together it 's mighty funny , the end of time have just begin oh , honey , after all these year you be still the one while I be strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind I leave my life with you somewhere back there along the line I think somehow that I would be spared this fate but I do not know how much longer I can wait
