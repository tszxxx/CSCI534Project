Time enough for life to unfold
All the precious things life has in store
And we got all the love in the world
And as time goes by you will find we need nothing more
And every step of the way we'll find us
With the kiss of the world behind us
And we got all the time in the world for love
Nothing more, nothing less, only love
And every step of the way will find us
With the kiss of the world behind us, yea
We got all the time in the world for love
Nothing more, nothing less, only love
Only love, yea baby
