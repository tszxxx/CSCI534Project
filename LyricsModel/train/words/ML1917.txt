you be fracture and cold but you heart be unbroken 
my favourite foremost coastal antarctic shelf 
oh Larsen B oh you can fall on I 
oh Larsen B desalinate the barren sea 
oh I I think it be over again 
like sawblade through the air 
you winter overture 
cut through everything and now we be not so sure 
oh Larsen B oh will not you fall on I 
you have twelve thousand year 
and now it be all over 
five hundred billion tonne of the purest pack ice and snow 
oh Larsen B oh will not you fall on I 
oh Larsen B desalinate the barren sea 
oh I think it be the start of the end 
like sawblade through the air 
you winter overture 
cut through everything and now we be not so sure 
oh Larsen B oh fall on I 
oh Larsen B oh fall on I 
oh Larsen B oh Larsen B 
oh will not you fall on I 
oh you can fall on I
