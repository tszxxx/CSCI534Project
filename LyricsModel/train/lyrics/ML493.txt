Let's get lost
Lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost
Let them send out alarms
And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's tell the world
We're in that crazy mood
Let's defrost
In a romantic mist
Let's get crossed
Off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Mmm, let's get lost
Let's defrost
In a romantic mist
Let's get crossed
Off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Mmm, let's get lost
