at night they would go walk ' Til the break of the day the morning be for sleeping through the dark street they go search to see God in they own way save the night time for you weep you weep sing la - la - la - la - la - la - lay and the night over London lay so we rode down to the river where victorian ghost pray for they curse to be break we go wander ' neath the arch where the witch be and they say " there be ghost town in the ocean " the ocean sing la - la - la - la - la - la - lay and the night over London lay God be in the house and God be in my head and all the cemetery of London I see God come in my garden but I do not know what he say for my heart it be not open not open sing la - la - la - la - la - la - lay and the night over London lay sing la - la - la - la - la - la - lay there 's no light over London today
