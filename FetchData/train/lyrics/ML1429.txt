[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over (Yeah)
When I saw you and her talking deep
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh
[Chorus]
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me child naw naw whoo ooh
[Verse 2]
So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free now whoo ooh, Woo oh
I w
as just, I was just, I was
 just sitting here thinking of your kiss
And your warm embrace yeah
When a reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face whoo ooh
[Chorus]
And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
And baby, baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me
