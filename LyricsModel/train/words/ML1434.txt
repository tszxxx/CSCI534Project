now my room have get two window but the sunshine never come through you know it 's always dark and dreary since I break off , baby with you I live on a lonely avenue my little girl would not say I do well , I feel so sad and blue and it 's all because of you I could cry , I could cry , I could cry I could die , I could die , I could die because I live on a lonely avenue Lonely avenue now my cover they feel like lead and my pillow it feel like stone well , I have toss and turn so every night I be not use to be alone I live on a lonely avenue my little girl would not say I do well , I feel so sad and blue and it 's all because of you now I have be so sad and lonesome since you have leave this town you know if I could beg or borrow the money child , I would be a highway bound I live on a lonely avenue my little girl would not say I do well , I feel so sad and blue you know it 's all because of you
