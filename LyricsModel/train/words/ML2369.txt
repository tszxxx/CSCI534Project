I use to be a fool 
and think that life be cruel and full of hate 
but now I see 
thing be not so bad 
if only I have have someone to hold my hand like you 
I would do it the and 
I be so happy now 
you change my life somehow 
I be so happy now 
and now that I be free 
from all that misery and I can smile again 
cause you 
come into my life 
Said you would be my wife and make I realize that life 
be wonderful 
and 
I be so happy now 
you change my life somehow 
I be so happy now 
I be so happy now 
you change my life somehow 
I be so happy now 
I be so happy now 
you change my life somehow 
I be so happy now
