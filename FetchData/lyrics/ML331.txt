Sometimes I believe that everything is what it seems
And we&rsquo;re just to scared to try
Do we have what it takes when hope and clarity melt away
To rise above our mistakes
If we don&rsquo;t know any other way
And we&rsquo;re just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So let&rsquo;s take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn&rsquo;t over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
Sometimes there can be so much more beyond what we see
Sometimes I&rsquo;m amazed how we see the world in different ways
And we&rsquo;re just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So let&rsquo;s take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn&rsquo;t over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
Sometimes I&rsquo;m afraid of what I might not get to say
And we&rsquo;re just too scared to try
Yeah we&rsquo;re just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So let&rsquo;s take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn&rsquo;t over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
So let&rsquo;s take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn&rsquo;t over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
