[Verse 1]
Nothing suffocates you more than
The passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask
You make your children breathe in to survive
[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world
That doesn't give a shit
[Pre-Hook]
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
[Hook]
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
[Verse 2]
You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Celebrated victim of your fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today
[Pre-Hook]
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world
That doesn't give a shit
[Bridge]
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of millions' just a statistic
[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world
That doesn't give a shit
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world
That doesn't give a shit
[Hook]
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
