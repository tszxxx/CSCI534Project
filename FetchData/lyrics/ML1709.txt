[Verse 1]
People making lists, buying special gifts
It's a time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store
[Chorus]
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love, oh
[Verse 2]
People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say
[Outro]
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know that there's one cares
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Tom, Dick, and Harry, and Suzy, too
Need love every day as much as you
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
