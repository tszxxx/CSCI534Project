start off sometimes now it be we time 
be you with I be you with I 
strange teenager wait for death at 19 
be you with I be you with I 
I be with you and there be nothing leave to do 
tell I it be true 
I be with you and the star be crash through 
tell I it be true I want everything with you 
never someone say you be no one 
be you with I be you with I 
strange teenager you will never know death at 19 
be you with I be you with I 
I be with you and there be nothing leave to do 
tell I it be true 
I be with you and the star be crash through 
tell I it be true I want everything with you
