I be wait for you to notice I 
I be hang around for a minute 
baby do not give I u it will not hurt I 
I do not even know if u deserve I 
but with that moon in the sky 
who want to be alone 
and when the star shine so bright 
who want to be alone 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
right next to I

I be goin nowhere in a hurry 
baby come take away all my worry 
but with that moon in the sky 
who want to be alone 
and when the star shine so bright 
who want to be alone 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
right next to I

till the sun come up 
I be out of my head 
I be out of my head 
I be out of my head 
I be out of my head 
I be out of my head 
but with that moon in the sky 
who want to be alone 
and when the star shine so bright 
who want to be alone 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
do not take I home till the sun come up till the sun come up 
right next to I 
you want to be
