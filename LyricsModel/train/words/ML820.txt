do not know why there be no sun up in the sky stormy weather 
since my gal and I be not together keep rain all the time 
life be bare gloom and misery everywhere stormy weather 
just can not get my poor old self together 
I be weary all the time the time 
so weary all the time 
when she go away the blue walk in and they meet I 
if she stay away that old rocking chair be go to get I 
all I do be pray the Lord above will let I 
walk in the sun once more 
can not go on everything I have be go stormy weather 
since my gal and I be not together 
keep rain all the time 
keep rain all the time 
can not go on everything I have be go stormy weather 
since my gal and I be not together 
keep rain all the time the time 
keep rain all the time
