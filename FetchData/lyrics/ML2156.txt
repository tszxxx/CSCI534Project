And surrender to me
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully
Yeah, use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's gotta be
There ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one that love you so
So forget the other boy
'Cause my love is real
Come off your battlefield
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully
Yeah, use your arms to squeeze and please
'Cause I'm the one that love you so
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
And some day, you're gonna see
'Cause my love, baby
Is the truest you've ever had
I'm a soldier of love at heart to be
Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And lay down peacefully
Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And love me tenderly
Yeah, use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more
Baby, lay down your arms...
