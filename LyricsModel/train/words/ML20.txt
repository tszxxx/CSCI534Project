life can be so fair 
let it go on and on 
I can push for good 
you get that cherry bomb 
blow out that cherry bomb for I 
we lose it long ago 
you and I 
now you know you way 
back from the spirit bar 
brush you tooth for bed 
blow out that cherry bomb 
blow out that cherry bomb for I 
you get to know it be on you sleeve 
know it be on you sleeve 
know it be on you sleeve 
it be the longest day that I would ever know and 
I watch you start that drive alone 
blow out that cherry bomb for I 
it be go to burn right up you sleeve 
burn right up you sleeve 
so there you go again 
out in you dressing gow and 
get yourself to bed 
blow out that cherry bomb 
oh life could be so fair let it go on and on 
I could pay to that hand on you cherry bomb 
oh life could be so fair let it go on and on 
I could pay to that hand on you cherry bomb
