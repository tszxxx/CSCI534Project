blast we way through the boundary of Hell 
no one can stop we tonight 
we take on the world with hatred inside 
mayhem the reason we fight 
survive the slaughter and killing we have lose 
then we return from the dead 
attack once more now with twice as much strength 
we conquer then move on ahead 
Evil 
my word defy 
Evil 
have no disguise 
Evil 
will take you soul 
Evil 
my wrath unfold 
Satan we master in evil mayhem 
guide we with every first step 
we axe be grow with power and fury 
soon there will be nothingness leave 
Midnight have come and the leather strap on 
evil be at we command 
we clash with God 's angel and conquer new soul 
consume all that we can and 
Evil 
Evil 
have no disguise 
Evil 
will take you soul 
Evil 
my wrath unfold
