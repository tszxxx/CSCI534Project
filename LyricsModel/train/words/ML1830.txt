a dead issue 
do not wrestle with it 
deaf ear be sleep 
a guilty bliss 
so invite 
nail to the cross 
wash away we all 
take we with the flood 
then throughout the night they be rape and execute 
cold hearted world 
you language unheard of 
the vast sound of tuning out 
the rash of negativity 
be see one sidedly 
burn away the day 
wash away we all 
take we with the flood 
then throughout the day mankind play with grenade 
cold hearted world 
and at night they might bait the pentagram 
extinguish the sun 
wash away a man take he with the flood 
flood 
flood 
flood 
flood
