[Verse 1: Katie White]
Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, not keeping me together
People around got to find something to say now
Holding back, every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name
[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
[Verse 2: Katie]
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name
[Chorus 1: Katie]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
[Chorus 2: Jules]
This song was in my head
Now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding
And baby, can't you see
That you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long
This song is monotone
I've gotta get some soul, I gotta get some feeling
[Bridge: Katie]
Are you calling me Darling?
Are you calling me Bird?
Are you calling me Darling?
Are you calling me Bird?
[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
[Bridge]
Are
You
Calling
Me
Darling?
Are
You
Calling
Me
Bird?
[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
[Bridge]
Are
You
Calling
Me
Darling?
Are
You
Calling
Me
Bird?

[Ad lib: Katie]
So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered they forget my name
[Chorus 2: Jules]

Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
