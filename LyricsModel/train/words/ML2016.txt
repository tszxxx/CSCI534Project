Christmas without you 
White Christmas and I be blue 
like firework with no fuse 
Christmas without you 
the fireplace keep burn 
and my thought keep turn 
the page of memory 
of time spend with you 
old Christmas song we know 
and use to make love to 
make it hard to get use to 
Christmas without you 
Christmas without you 
White Christmas and I be blue 
I love you I miss you 
so sad but so true 
Christmas without you 
like a mystery with no clue 
like firework with no fuse 
Christmas without you 
the sweetest gift I know 
would be if the new snow 
could fall on you footstep 
on this Christmas Eve 
the most joyous Christmas 
if luck could be with we 
would be if Saint Nicholas 
bring you home to I 
Christmas without you 
White Christmas and I be blue 
I love you I miss you I need you 
so sad but so true 
Christmas without you 
like a mystery with no clue 
like firework with no fuse 
Christmas without you 
Christmas without you 
White Christmas and I be blue 
I love you I miss you 
so sad but so true 
Christmas without you 
I just can not get use to 
I just have no use 
for Christmas without you 
you know that I want you 
you know that I need you 
you know that I need you 
you know that I want you 
you know that I love you 
I need you 
I want you 
oh yes I do 
you know that I want you 
you know that I need you 
you know that I need you 
you know that I want you
