we be fall throughout eternity 
the clock be tick and you be still count sheep 
and you be still half asleep 
there be no one come 
and there be no way out 
I have be fall 
and it be so far down 
shroud beneath a veil of tragedy 
when death come call who will you believe 
tell I who would you believe 
when it be down to you and I will you still stay on you knee 
there be no one come 
and there be no way out 
I have be fall 
and it be so far down 
there be no one come 
and there be no way out 
there be no way out 
no way out 
push I down break I down 
there be always something push I down break I down 
push I down break I down 
there be always something push you down break I down 
push I down break I down 
there be always something push you down break I down 
push I down break I down 
there be always something push you back push you back 
rise 
there be no one come 
and there be no way out 
well I have be fall 
and it be a long way dow and
