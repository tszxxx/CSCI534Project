beyond you there be a forever 
beyond you there be a sun 
beyond you there be no never 
beyond you there be someone 
after this it will be spring 
after this there will be dusk 
after this bird will sing 
after this there will be love 
beyond you I will see clearly 
beyond you my heart will soar 
beyond you I will love dearly 
that be what I be pray for 
that be what I be pray for 
beyond you I will see clearly 
beyond you my heart will soar 
beyond you I will love dearly 
that be what I be pray for 
that be what I be pray for 
that be what I be pray for 
that be what I be pray for
