alright 
my dirthouse 
watch it happen from a box 
mind wander 
dirty dirty word 
my dirthouse 
this be where it all come dow and 
look into my eye 
you feel my skin it be dirt 
drive I wild 
remember when you blow my mind 
cut through I 
live in the dirt 
these dog be curl up in a little ball 
these dog be freezing they ass off 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I want to call this my home 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I have get some pain of my own 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I want to call this my home 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I have get some pain of my own 
open the box 
see what be inside 
you make the call 
sick of it all again 
tear I down 
push on my every nerve 
scare I 
I hope i do not get burnt 
look closer 
look into my dirty mind 
feel sick inside 
my blood have turn to fuck dirt 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I want to call this my home 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I have get some pain of my own 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I want to call this my home 
go go go 
pick up the piece 
I have get some pain of my own
