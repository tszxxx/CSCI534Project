I be not get no use for you red rocking chair 
I be not get no sugar baby now 
no I be not get no honey baby now 
and it be who will rock the cradle and who ´ll sing this song 
who will be you honey when I be go 
who will be you honey when I be go 
I will rock the cradle and I will sing this song 
I will rock the cradle when you be go 
yes I will rock the cradle when you be go 
lay she in the shade give she every dime I make 
what more could a poor boy do 
what more could a poor boy do 
I have do all I can do say all I can say 
I will sing it to you mama next payday 
I will sing it to you mama next payday 
some old rounder come along take my sugar babe and go 
and I be not get no sugar baby now 
no I be not get no honey baby now
