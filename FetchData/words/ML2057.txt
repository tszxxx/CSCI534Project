you know I be a dreamer but my heart' of gold I have to run away high so I would not come home low just when thing go right it do not mean they be always wrong just take this song and you will never feel leave all alone take I to you heart feel I in you bone just one more night and I be come off this long &amp ; wind road I be on my way I be on my way Home sweet home tonight , tonight I be on my way I be on my way Home sweet home you know that I have see so many romantic dream up in light , fall off the silver screen my heart like a open book for the whole world to read sometimes nothing keep I together at the seam I be on my way I be on my way Home sweet home tonight , tonight I be on my way just set I free Home sweet home Um , I be on my way I be on my way Home sweet home yeah ... I be on my way just set I free Home sweet home
