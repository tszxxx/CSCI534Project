she look so much like a lady but she be so much like a child 
a devil when she hold I close a angel when she smil 
she always hold it deep inside but somehow I always know 
she be go away when the grass turn green and the sky turn baby blue 
and baby blue be the color of she eye 
baby blue like the Colorado sky 
like a breath of spring she come and leave 
and I still do not know why 
so here be to you and whoever hold my baby blue tonight 
she bring color to my life that my eye have never touch 
and when she teach I how to care I never care so much 
I try not to think of she but I fall asleep and do 
and drift off where the grass be green and the sky be baby blue 
and baby blue be the color of she eye 
baby blue like the Colorado sky 
like a breath of spring she come and leave 
and I still do not know why 
so here be to you and whoever hold my baby blue tonight 
Baby blue be the color of she eye 
baby blue like the Colorado sky 
like a breath of spring she come and leave 
and I still do not know why 
so here be to you and whoever hold my baby blue tonight 
Baby blue be the color of she eye 
baby blue like the Colorado sky 
Baby blue be the color of she eye 
baby blue like the Colorado sky 
Baby blue be the color of she eye 
baby blue like the Colorado sky 
Baby blue
