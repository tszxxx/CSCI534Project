[Pre-Chorus][x2]
I feel the pain of everyone
Then I feel nothing
I feel the pain of everyone
Then I feel nothing
[Chorus]
Is it up to me?
You won't wait to see
Screwed us both again
About as close as you dare
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
Is it up to me?
You won't wait to see
Screwed us yet again
About as close as you dare
Hey now, take it back
Get off the attack
Trailin' on your scene
Just try and keep it clean
