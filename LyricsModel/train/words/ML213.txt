I will break into you thought 
with what be write on my heart 
I will break 
break 
I be so sick 
infect with where I live 
let I live without this 
empty bliss 
selfishness 
I be so sick 
I be so sick 
if you want more of this 
we can push out sell out die out 
so you will shut up 
and stay sleeping 
with my scream in you 
itch ear 
I be so sick 
infect with where I live 
let I live without this 
empty bliss 
selfishness 
I be so sick 
I be so sick 
hear it I be scream it 
you be heed to it now 
hear it I be scream it 
you tremble at this sound 
you sink into my clothes 
and this invasion 
make I feel 
worthless hopeless sick 
I be so sick 
infect with where I live 
let I live without this 
empty bliss 
selfishness 
I be so sick 
I be so sick 
I be so sick 
infect with where I live 
let I live without this 
empty bliss selfishness 
I be so 
I be so sick 
I be so 
I be so sick
