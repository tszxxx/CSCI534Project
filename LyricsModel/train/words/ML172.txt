I be in love again 
be like this before 
I be in love again 
this time be true I be sure 
do not want to end up like no nine day wonder 
I have be hurt so many time before 
so my darling I will never leave you 
it be in my blood to always love you more love you more 
it be my heart again 
that drive I so wild 
I just can not explain 
although I be not a child 
so why would I cry if you ever leave I 
maybe cause you be all I be live for 
with every heartbeat I want you madly 
it be in my blood to always love you more love you more 
oh my love again 
what I say be true 
though it may sound plain 
I love you 
and it mean more to I than life can offer 
and if this be not true love then I be sure 
that after this love there will be no other 
until the razor cut
