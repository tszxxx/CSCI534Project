I do not love the mountain 
and I do not love the sea 
and I do not love Jesus 
he never do a thing for I 
I be not pretty like my sister 
or smart like my dad 
or good like my mama 
it be money that I love 
it be money that I love 
they say that money 
can not buy love in this world 
but it will get you a half pound of cocaine 
and a sixteen year old girl 
and a great big long limousine 
on a hot September night 
now that may not be love 
but it be all right 
one two 
it be money that I love 
wanna kiss you 
three four 
it be money that I love 
use to worry about the poor 
but I do not worry anymore 
use to worry about the black man 
now I do not worry about the black man 
use to worry about the starve child of India 
you know what I say now about the starve child of India 
I say oh momma 
it be money that I love 
it be money that I love 
it be money that I love
