come on along and listen to 
the lullaby of Broadway 
the hip hooray and bally hoo 
a lullaby of Broadway 
the rumble of the subway train 
the rattle of the taxis 
the daffodil who entertain 
at Angelo 's and Maxi 's 
when a Broadway baby say good night 
it be early in the morning 
Manhattan baby do not sleep tight 
until the daw and 
good night baby 
good night the milkman 's on he way 
sleep tight baby 
sleep tight let 's call it a day hey 
come on along and listen to 
the lullaby of Broadway 
the band begin to go to town 
and everything grow hazy 
you rock a bye you baby round 
to Ellington and Basie 
when a Broadway baby say good night 
it be early in the morning 
Manhattan baby do not sleep tight 
until the daw and 
good night baby 
good night the milkman 's on he way 
sleep tight baby 
sleep tight let 's call it a day 
but listen to the lullaby of Broadway 
good night baby 
good night the milkman 's on he way 
sleep tight baby 
sleep tight let 's call it a day 
but listen to the lullaby of Broadway
