hey have you ever try 
really reach out for the other side 
I may be climb on rainbow 
but baby here go 
dream they be for those who sleep 
life be for we to keep 
and if you be wonder 
what this song be lead to 
I want to make it with you 
I really think that 
we can make it girl 
no you do not know I well 
and every little thing 
only time will tell 
if you believe the thing that I do 
and we will see it through 
life can be short or long 
love can be right or wrong 
and if I choose the one 
I would like to help I through 
I would like to make it with you 
I really think that 
we can make it girl 
baby you know that 
dream they be for those who sleep 
life it be for we to keep 
and if I choose the one 
I would like to help I through 
I would like to make it with you 
I really think that 
we could make it girl
