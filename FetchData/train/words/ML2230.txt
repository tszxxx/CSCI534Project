sister can you hear I now the ring in you ear I be down on the ground my luck 's be dry for year I be lose in the dark and I feel like a dinosaur Broken face and break hand I be a break man I have hit the wall I be about to fall but I be close in on it I feel so weak on a lose streak watch my taillight fade to black I read a thing about this girl she be a hermit in she world she story be much like mine she could be my valentine and although we have never meet I will not forget she yet she cut herself off from she past now she 's alone at last I feel so sick lose love 's last lick but I be close down on it I feel so weak on a lose streak watch my taillight fade to black lose my life in cheap wine now it 's quiet time Cappy Dick nor Jesus Christ could not help my fate but I be underneath a gun I be sing about my past have myself a wonderful thing but I could not make it last I have hit the wall I be about to fall but I be close in on it I feel so small Underneath it all watch my taillight fade to black .. watch my taillight fade .. watch my taillight fade .. watch my taillight fade
