they take I lightly like a quiet boosting of a piece of candy 
from you favorite neighborhood corner store 
surely should a see the weight 
a heavy burden to carry the bare soil slate 
they do not want to have a thing to do with 
can not blame they take a look 
can not name them cause they shook 
take over some wit protect 
stay with you kin boy 
fuck around with B'more 
make you look like you be white in a Harlem shaking contest 
I harness the fondest crook of phonic 
fuck grammar ill mannered 
do not start with spank 
tell I what it look like tell I what it be 
tell I what it look like tell I what it be 
awww ease up motherfucker take a breath 
you look beat I be more you be more the less 
oh ease up motherfucker take a breath 
you look beat now now I suggest you take a rest 
can not say what I will or will not do 
stretch the height 
you might want to stay on you toe to 
secure a full view 
for skew vision condition lead you to assume 
and while you assume 
I be feel uneasy 
my pattern be break 
share my thought but my gut do not even believe I 
sleep do not relieve I it be like doom conceive I 
get a whole lot of something yet I constantly feel 
like nothing much just you average such and such 
so much acclaim moving

if you do not pull I back spitting on he new shoe 
what be he think
