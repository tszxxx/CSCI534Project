Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich
And your ma is good lookin'
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry
One of these mornin's
You're goin' to rise up singin'
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take the sky
But till that mornin'
There's a-nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy
Standin' by
One of these mornin's
You're goin' to rise up singin'
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take the sky
But till that mornin'
There's a-nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy
Standin' by
