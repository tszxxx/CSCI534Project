[Intro:]
Oh, me
You know
I never meant for this to happen
But if it's wrong
I just feel so right
[Chorus:]
You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
All rare but sensitive
Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me
And feel all the things I want to feel
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home
[Verse 1:]
I was just out on the town
In search of some fun
I was looking for love
Then you came along and shared with me
All the things I miss at home
[Repeat Chorus:]
[Verse 2:]
Oh, yes
I do love someone
But I can't pretend to be the happy one
You're taken for granted
I was lonely (so lonely)
But you were there for me
[Chorus:]
[Cherrelle:]
You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
[Alexander O'Neal]
Girl, I understand your needs
[Cherrelle:]
All rare, but sensitive
Everything I miss at home
[Alexander O'Neal:]
Ooh-wee, baby
[Cherrelle:]
You know how to hold me
[Alexander O'Neal:]
I wanna hold you, baby
[Cherrelle:]
And do all the things I want to feel
[Alexander O'Neal:]
Oh, I wanna feel you, girl
[Cherrelle:]
Inside of each tender kiss
Oh, oh
I get everything I miss at home
[Alexander O'Neal:]
Home is where the heart is, baby
[Cherrelle:]
Things I miss at home
[Alexander O'Neal:]
And I'm at home
[Cherrelle:]
Home is where you let your feelings show
Things I miss at home
[Alexander O'Neal:]
Everything I know
[Cherrelle:]
Till I met you I felt all alone
Things I miss at home
Now you're giving me everything I miss at home
[Alexander O'Neal:]
You're at home, baby
[Cherrelle:]
Things I miss at home
[Alexander O'Neal:]
And you don't have to go nowhere
[Cherrelle:]
Things I miss at home
Things I miss at home
You're giving me everything I miss at home
