I be look for that Lonely Street 
I have get a sad sad tale to tell 
I need a place to go and weep 
where be this place call Lonely Street 
a place where there be just loneliness 
where dim light bring forgetfulness 
where broken dream and memory meet 
where be this place call Lonely Street 
perhaps upon that Lonely Street 
there be someone such as I 
who come to bury broken dream 
and watch a old love die 
if I could find that Lonely Street 
where dim light bring forgetfulness 
where broken dream and memory meet 
where be this place call Lonely Street 
where be this place call Lonely Street
