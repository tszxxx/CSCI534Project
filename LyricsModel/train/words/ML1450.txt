a poison culture base on lie war &amp deceit 
slaughterhouse philosophy cruel butcher be hard to beat 
the law of the game be the law of the bloody blade 
dictate by lunacy it be the fail death serenade 
war as the essence of a painful life 
decay the stream of death agony will ride 
hate hate be my fuel 
the mob be just tool 
hate hate be my fuel 
I be the lord of misrule 
death bring we together as one the feel to be second to none 
shameful should be the gluttonous what make a real genius 
erase all the treasure wipe out all fame affluence and wealth 
recognize the afterlife freedom will not be base on stealth 
war as the essence of a painful life 
decay the stream of death agony will ride 
hate hate be my fuel 
the mob be just tool 
hate hate be my fuel 
I be the lord of misrule 
insanity we do rape wreck and then we search for a excuse 
decay we all go to rot we be all the same on the final cruise 
modesty be so hard to find be this a curse be this real 
consistency be a gift of life education be the deal 
hate hate be my fuel 
the mob be just tool 
hate hate be my fuel 
I be the lord of misrule
