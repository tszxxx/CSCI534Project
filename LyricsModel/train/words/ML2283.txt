at the dawn of violence 
the Telkhine wizard meet 
on the peat of Mt. Cithren 
they vow malevolence 
the call for death be send 
to command all earth and I and 
behead the mega priest 
bring hell unto the street 
I hear voice 
make I kill 
I hear voice 
make I kill 
evil power 
evil power 
evil power 
on the wing of malcontent 
another billion dead 
upon you bated breath 
they calculate death 
demonic influence 
completely pull I in 
we fist raise to the sky 
as we watch the goddess die 
I hear voice 
make I kill 
I hear voice 
slaughter 
evil power 
evil power 
evil power
