I turn the other way 
I will never turn you dow and 
you turn I on 
do not speak out every meaning 
I do not belong to you 
you do not belong to I 
so do not hold on too tightly 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
happier now than I have be in the past 
go be the day 
go be the tear 
that be a girl I use to be 
the girl that you now see stand in front of you 
could keep go on 
because she believe 
in set you free 
so let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
I turn the other way 
I can never turn you dow and 
you turn I on 
do not speak out every meaning 
I do not belong to you 
like you do not belong to I 
so do not hold on too tightly 
let forever be 
so let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
they be all the same in this cynical age 
I will not be you ball and chain 
I risk my reputation 
just to get a room 
you always have the reservation 
so come lie down beside I 
beside I 
beside I 
beside I 
so let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
let I know when you be lonely babe 
let I know when you be lonely baby 
that could be okay 
it might be sweet 
if we could meet 
along the way 
that could be okay
