[Verse 1]
I can't stay away from you too long
Even if I do, I always call
Checking on you, make sure you are OK
Be the one to brighten up your day, yeah yeah
[Chorus 1]
And the point of it all is I love you, yeah
You know I love you baby, oh
[Verse 2]
My day seem long whenever we're apart
Its like someone has thrown away my heart
You're a major part of my life
And nommatter what the storm may bring, I'm fine with you
[Chorus 2]
And the point of it all is I love you
And the reason for it all is I love you
[Bridge]
(I love you girl) oh I love you
(I love you girl) oh I love you
(Oh I love you girl) oh I love you girl
Yeah oh
I can't stay
(I can't stay away from you too long)
I can't stay away from you baby
(I can't stay away too long)
Don't wanna be without you

(I can't stay away too long)
Oh why don't you stay around for a while?
(I can't away too long)
[Outro]
And the point of it all
