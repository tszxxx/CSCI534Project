you you never call 
you never write I or nothing 
I set myself up to fall 
I be stupid then to try 
and I be live a lie 
I be in a fantasy world 
but the hero will not win this time 
cause a pipe dream get flush away 
by all means I be gettin mad 
but that do not mean I do not feel sorry for ya 
how sad you be go to be 
I wish I could stick around 
to see you face when you realize you have permanently change 
and it be all thanks to I 
I be wrong for come here 
you will wake alone and run around you lonely home 
look for my face but I be already go 
you you never call 
you never write I or nothing 
I set myself up to fall 
I be stupid then to try 
there be something in the way 
something in the way 
something in the way that you shut the door 
I could not get enough when you would blow I off 
I just keep drag myself back for more 
by all means I be gettin mad 
but that do not mean I do not feel sorry for ya 
how sad you be go to be 
I wish I could stick around 
to see you face when you realize you have permanently change 
and it be all thanks to I 
I be wrong for come here 
you be ™ll wake alone and run around you lonely home 
look for my face but I be already go 
one day you be go to see 
the life sentence you give to I 
but I swear one day we will share this cell 
I know it be cold but I will keep we warm 
with all the hate I radiate 
we will be walk hand in hand in hell 
how sad you be go to be 
I wish I could stick around 
to see you face when you realize you have permanently change 
and it be all thanks to I 
I be wrong for come here 
you will wake alone and run around you lonely home 
look for my face but I be already go
