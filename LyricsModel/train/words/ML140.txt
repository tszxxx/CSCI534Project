tongue tie or short of breath 
do not even try 
try a little harder 
something be wrong 
you be not naive you must be strong 
ooh baby try 
hey girl move a little closer 
you be too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush 
modern medicine fall short of you complaint 
ooh try a little harder 
move in circle will not you dilate 
ooh baby try 
hey girl move a little closer 
cause you be too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush 
you be too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush eye to eye 
too shy shy hush hush
