I know I can count on you 
sometimes I feel like say Lord I just do not care 
but you have get the love I need to see I through 
sometimes it seem the go be just too rough 
and thing go wrong no matter what I do 
now and then it seem that life be just too much 
but you have get the love I need to see I through

when friend be go I know my savior 's love be real 
you know it be real 
cause you have get the love you have get the love

time after time I think oh Lord what be the use 
time after time I think it be just no good 
cause sooner or later in life the thing you love you lose 
but you have get the love I need to see I through 
you have get the love you have get the love

cause I know I can count on you oh 
sometimes I feel like say Lord I just do not care 
but you have get the love I need to see I through
