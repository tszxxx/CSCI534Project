[Verse 1]
Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him
Though He slay me, I'll trust in the Lord
Though talked about and misunderstood
Yes, I've been lied on, but still have my joy
[Pre-Hook]
Weeping may endure for a night
But I'm glad that I still have joy
[Hook]
After all that I've been through
I still have my joy
[Vamp]
Oh, oh, oh
This joy I have, the world didn't give it
This joy I have, the world can't take it away
[Hook]
After all that I've been through
After all that I've been through
After all that I've been through
I still have my joy
I still have joy
Still have joy
I still have joy
Still have joy
I still have joy
Still have joy
I still have joy
I still have joy
I still have joy
I still have joy
After all that I've been through
After all that I've been through
After all that I've been through
After all that I've been through
