oh since my baby leave I 
I have find new place to dwell 
down at the end on a lonely street 
that Heartbreak Hotel 
and I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely I could die 
and although it be always crowded 
you still can find some room 
for break hearted lover 
to cry away they gloom 
and I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely I could die 
well the bellhop 's tear keep flow 
the desk clerk be dress in black 
they have be so long on a lonely street 
they will never never never get back 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely I could die 
so if you baby leave 
you get a tale to tell 
just take a walk down lonely street 
to Heartbreak Hotel 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely I could die 
oh since my baby leave I 
I have find a new place to dwell 
down at the end on a lonely street 
that Heartbreak Hotel 
and I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely baby 
I get so lonely I could die 
and I get so lonely I could die
