this twist wretch place shadow by the utmost dark of hell 
in dream of black beyond the bound of a wither witch 's spell 
where the door surely be lock when the sun threaten to wane 
where shambler dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day 
liar line the road at daw and 
watchful eye be upon you hold 
Sacred weapon to the sacred reveal to be unleash it be the council of hell 
Blood flow down the street at night where wolf cry out for flesh 
where a horrible curse taint the woodland nearby with the form of the walking dead 
unholy inversion of hope 
twist the faith of the meek into hate 
drive insane by the dark one to bring forth the foul bidding he speak 
the undead be among we at dawn they shrink back to they silken bed 
they dance by night and drink the blood of a child 's broken neck 
he spire be grow taller still they shadow spread throughout the land 
free the evil that sleep within the weaker mind of man 
into the tower never go the horror multiply 
the gear can mince the strongest one leave heroe paralyzed 
the river flow with poison 
the sand swallow you whole 
the ghoul that roam this darken wood be thirst for you throat 
unholy inversion of hope twist the faith of the meek into hate 
drive insane by the dark one to bring forth the foul bidding he speak 
the undead be among we at dawn they shrink back to they silken bed 
they dance by night and drink the blood of a child 's broken neck 
he spire be grow taller still they shadow spread throughout the land 
free the evil that sleep within the weaker mind of man
