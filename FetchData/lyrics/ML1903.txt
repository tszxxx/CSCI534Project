[Intro/Half Chorus: Andrea Ferro 
and
 
Cristina Scabbia
]
I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive 
(survive)
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
But 
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
[Verse: Cristina]
I can't leave this, I am fine inside it
I don't feel bliss, and I just keep hiding
I've been burnt so bad but I still play with fire
Sometimes naked truth is what I don't believe in
[Chorus: Andrea 
and
 
Cristina
]
I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive 
(survive)
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
But 
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I cannot get so deep into this now
I can't admit that I know what I know, and
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
[Verse: Cristina]
It's hard to hear through the static again
It's never clear until the rush of pain
I'll never tell you I'm living a lie
In this confusion I feel alive
[Bridge: Cristina]
I've been burnt so bad but I still play with fire
Sometimes naked truth is what I can't believe in
[Chorus: Andrea 
and
 
Cristina
]
I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive 
(survive)
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
But 
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I cannot get so deep into this now
I can't admit that I know what I know, and
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
[Verse: Cristina]
Don't ever tell me I'm falling apart
Don't ever tell me I will not survive
Don't ever tell me this love is a lie
'Cause I am the lie, I am the liar
[Chorus/Outro: Andrea 
and
 
Cristina
]
I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive 
(survive)
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
But 
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I cannot get so deep into this now
I can't admit that I know what I know, and
I wanna tell you your love is a lie
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I won't tell you
