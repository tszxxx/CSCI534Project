after the flame 
when the field be cold 
and after the pain 
when the heart be gold 
you will find a brand new day 
with the bird upon the wire 
and all you really have to pay 
be the price of the fire 
and in we younger day 
you could say we be wild 
in we hungry way 
the safety line be file 
we be run on the rim 
we be burn out the tire 
and all we really have to pay 
be the price of the fire 
oh all we really have to pay 
be the price of the fire 
and the breaker of heart 
they do not escape pain 
and you know when it start 
as you dive into the flame 
and there be a voice that tell you run 
but you call the voice a liar 
for all you really have to pay 
all you really have to pay 
be the price of the fire 
be the price of the fire
