Joy to the world the Lord have come 
let Earth receive she king 
let every heart prepare he room 
and Heaven and nature sing 
and Heaven and nature sing 
and Heaven and Heaven and nature sing 
Joy to the World the Savior reign 
let man they song employ 
while field and flood rock hill and plain 
repeat the sounding joy

repeat repeat the sounding joy 
he rule the world with truth and grace 
and make the nation prove 
the glory of he righteousness 
and wonder of he love 
and wonder of he love 
and wonder wonder of he love 
Joy to the world the Lord have come 
let Earth receive she king 
let every heart prepare he room 
and Heaven and nature sing 
and Heaven and nature sing
