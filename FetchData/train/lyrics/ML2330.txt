Crane
Close your eyes clear your mind and you'll find you're free
Close your eyes clear your mind come on trust in me
You're riding down the highway, you ain't got no highway shoes
But if you're born with nothing child how can you ever, ever lose
Close your eyes (chorus)
Don'tcha know, Can'tcha see, You'll be free - It's alright
Don'tcha know, Can'tcha see, Trust in me - It's alright
Dont'cha know, Can'tcha see. You'll be free - It's alright
Let it go, Then you'll know, You can see
You'll be free - you'll be free - you'll be free
Close your eyes (chorus)
This goodbye to the things you thought you had
You won't care when you realize that life's just a dream, life is a dream that's true
Close your eyes (chorus)
