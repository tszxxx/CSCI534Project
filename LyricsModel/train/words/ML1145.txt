I can not read between the line 
of a letter 
that you have never write 
I can not begin to compromise 
on a problem 
that you have invent 
dead stare cut a paper heart 
and beat ink in these page 
letter write in regret 
to many lifeless face 
this be the end of I 
I be run on empty 
hour spend pour over these word 
with nothing gain 
all that be lose with nothing learn 
I be just feel drain 
this be take so much out of I 
I be doubt my place as of late 
I wish I could make this 
paper heart come alive 
all my time spend on 
write this living lie 
all my time spend on this lie
