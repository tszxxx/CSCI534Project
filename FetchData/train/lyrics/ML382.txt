[Chorus 1]
Moderation is masturbation
What is what and what makes you feel good
All these things I think about, I think about
Always come unglued
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me
[Verse]
This confusion is my illusion
Nowhere to look, but nowhere to find you
All these things I'm sick about
I'm sick about
Always come unglued
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 1]
Moderation is masturbation
What is what and what makes you feel good
All these things I think about
I think about
Always come unglued
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me
Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me
Yeah, wah-woo
