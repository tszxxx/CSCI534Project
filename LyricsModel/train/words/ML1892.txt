till the morning come 
it will do you fine 
till the morning come 
like a highway sign 
show you the way 
leave no doubt 
of the way on in 
or the way back out 
tell you what I will do 
I will watch out for you 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy 
make yourself easy 
make yourself easy 
till we all fall down 
it will do you fine 
do not think about 
what you leave behind 
the way you come 
or the way you go 
let you track be lose in the dark 
and snow 
tell you what I will do 
I will watch out for you 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy 
make yourself easy 
make yourself easy 
when the shadow grow 
it will do you fine 
when the cold wind blow 
it will ease you mind 
the shape it take 
could be yours to choose 
what you may win 
what you may lose 
tell you what I will do 
I will watch out for you 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy 
make yourself easy 
make yourself easy 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy 
you be my woman now 
make yourself easy
