you baby do not love you anymore golden day before they end whisper secret to the wind you baby will not be near you any more Tender night before they fly send fall star that seem to cry you baby do not want you anymore it 's over it break you heart in two , to know she 's be untrue but oh what will you do ? then she say to you there 's someone new we be through we be through it 's over it 's over it 's over all the rainbow in the sky start to weep , then say goodbye you will not be see rainbow any more set sun before they fall , echo to you that 's all that 's all but you will see lonely sunset after all it 's over it 's over it 's over it 's over
