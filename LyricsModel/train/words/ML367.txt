well I be a honky tonk man and I can not seem to stop 
I love to give the girl a whirl to the music of a old juke box 
but when my money be all go I be on the telephone singing 
hey hey mama can you daddy come home 
well now I be live wild and dangerously 
but I have get plenty of company 
when the moon come up and the sun go down 
well I can not wait to see the light of town 
cause I be a honky tonk man and I can not seem to stop 
I love to give the girl a whirl to the music of a old juke box 
but when my money be all go I be on the telephone singing 
hey hey mama can you daddy come home 
well I be a honky tonk man and I can not seem to stop 
I love to give the girl a whirl to the music of a old juke box 
but when my money be all go I be on the telephone singing 
hey hey mama can you daddy come home 
hey now a pretty little girl and a jug of wine 
well that be what it take to make a honky tonk time 
with the juke box moan those honky tonk sound 
well I can not wait to lay my money down 
cause I be a honky tonk man and I can not seem to stop 
I love to give the girl a whirl to the music of a old juke box 
but when my money be all go I be on the telephone singing 
hey hey mama can you daddy come home 
I be a honky tonk man and I can not seem to stop 
I love to give the girl a whirl to the music of a old juke box 
but when my money be all go I be on the telephone singing 
hey hey mama can you daddy come home
