[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
[Verse 2]
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause
[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 3]
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
[Verse 4]
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 5]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
