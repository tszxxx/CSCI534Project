you do not bring I flower you do not sing I love song you hardly talk to I anymore when you come through the door at the end of the day I remember when you could not wait to love I use to hate to leave I now after lovin ' I late at night when it 's good for you and you be feeling alright well , you just roll over and you turn out the light you do not bring I flower anymore it use to be so natural to talk about forever but ' use to be 's ' do not count anymore they just lay on the floor ' Til we sweep they away and baby , I remember all the thing you teach I I learn how to laugh and I learn how to cry well I learn how to love even learn how to lie you would think I could learn how to tell you goodbye ' cause you do not bring I flower anymore well , you would think I could learn how to tell you goodbye ' cause you do not bring I flower anymore
