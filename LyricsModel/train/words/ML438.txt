every morning when I wake up yawning 
I be still far away 
truck still roll through the early morning 
to the place we play 
Boy you be home you be dream do not you know 
the tour be still far away 
Boy you be home you be dream do not you know 
you be have just a break 
dream we be go out on stage it feel like 
come home again 
dream we be go out on stage it feel like 
come home again 
dream we be go out on stage it feel like 
year after year out on the road 
it be great to be here to see you all 
I know for I it be like 
come home 
day after day out on the road 
there be no place too far that we would not go 
we go wherever you like 
to rock and roll 
jump on the seat put you hand in the air 
give I a shout let I hear you be out there 
the wilder you scream for some more rock and roll 
the higher we will go 
year after year out on the road 
it be great to be here to rock you all 
I know for I it be like 
come home 
like come home
