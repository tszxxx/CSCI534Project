I think I be goin ' back to the thing I learn so well in my youth I think I be return to those day when I be young enough to know the truth now there be no game to only pass the time no more colour book no Christmas bell to chime but think young and grow older be no sin and I can play the game of life to win I can recall the time when I be not ashamed to reach out to a friend and now I think I have get a lot more than a skip rope to lend now there 's more to do than watch my sailboat glide and everyday can be my magic carpet ride and I can play hide and seek with my fear and live my day instead of count my year let everyone debate the true reality I would rather see the world the way it use to be a little bit of freedom 's all we lack so catch I if you can I be goin ' back
