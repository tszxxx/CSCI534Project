I do not want to be shy 
can not stand it anymore 
I just want to say Hi' 
to the one I love 
cherry blossom girl 
I feel sick all day long 
from not be with you 
I just want to go out 
every night for a while 
cherry blossom girl 
tell I why can not it be true 
I never talk to you 
people say that I should 
I can pray every day 
for the moment to come 
cherry blossom girl 
I just want to be sure 
when I will come to you 
when the time will be go 
you will be by my side 
cherry blossom girl 
tell I why can not it be true 
cherry blossom girl 
tell I why can not it be true 
I will never love again 
can I say that to you 
will you run away 
if I try to be true 
cherry blossom girl 
cherry blossom girl 
I will always be there for you 
that mean no time to waste 
whenever there be a chance 
cherry blossom girl 
tell I why can not it be true
