calloused and bruise 
Dazed and confused 
my spirit be leave want something more 
my selfish hope 
my selfish dream 
I be lie with my face down on the floor 
cry out for more 
cry out for more 
so give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
cause I can not think of anything worth say 
but I know that I owe you my life 
so give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
every night and every day 
I find that I have nothing I can say 
so I stand here in silence await you guidance 
I be want only you voice to be hear 
let them be you word 
let them be you word 
give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
cause I can not think of anything worth say 
but I know that I owe you my life 
give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
just do not understand this life that I have be live 
I just do not understand I just do not understand 
just do not understand these lie I have be believe 
I just do not understand just do not understand 
so give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
cause I can not think of anything worth say 
but I know that I owe you my life 
so give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
cause I can not think of anything worth say 
but I know that I owe you my life 
so give I word to speak 
do not let my spirit sleep 
I know I know I owe you my life 
owe my life 
owe my life 
I know that I owe you my life 
owe my life 
my life
