He left his cigarettes
How long before they're stale
I still smell him on my sheets
I linger in the memory
He said he's never been in love
And doesn't know what love means
So I tell him, so I tell him
To love is to release
Fear leads nowhere
Fear leads nowhere
It's easier to love than not to love
Aah aah
He left his cigarettes
How long before they're stale
I can't take much more of this
I linger in this emptiness
He said he's not ready for this
And doesn't know if he'll be
So I tell him, so I tell him
To love is to release
Fear leads nowhere
Fear leads nowhere
Fear leads nowhere
Fear leads nowhere
It's easier to love than not to love
It's easier to love to love to love to love
It's easier to love than not to love
It's easier to love to love
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you
It's easier to love than not to love
It's easier to love to love to love to love
It's easier to love than not to love
It's easier to love
Release, release
