I be not the hero out the gate 
so much to feel so much to gain 
my higher reason will take aim 
I will be okay I have get my shape 
we be not alone we share we stake 
and I think the winter will be wonderful 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without 
go alone we will split the chase 
to all the roll or drop the weight 
there be no allegiance step to take 
these great big sheet disintegrate 
you do not wanna you do not want to 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without it 
I be safe without 
but I feel this way 
feel this way 
I steal I kneel I do it again 
over and over and over and over
