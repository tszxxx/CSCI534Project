the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
with a pen in one hand take a stand drug on kerosene 
84 and 5 
would find we something to believe 
right or wrong with dirty hand on wire 
sing song in discord choir 
scream in Braille 
no temptress prize could ever yield anything so real 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
golden soldier bear much older than they will ever live to be 
dive into a sea of hand in a long forget city 
here the rain fall forever after 
and the swinging vine hang dead in rafter 
Blood rush to you head induce laughter endlessly 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
can not explain it it be something to see 
can not contain something ever real ever real 
ever real 
can not explain it it be something to see 
can not contain something ever real ever real 
ever real 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on 
the original fire have die and go but the riot inside move on
