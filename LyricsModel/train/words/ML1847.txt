close you eye 
take a deep breath 
open you heart 
and whisper 
tell I you love I 
tell I you love I 
you love I 
hold I tight 
do not say goodnight 
we have time 
everything alright 
hold I darl 
darl and tell I 
you love I 
no no no 
even though 
this be not the way I want it to be 
but if you 
get to pretend 
that be alright with I 
close you eye 
take a deep breath 
open you heart 
and whisper 
tell I you love I 
tell I you love I 
you love I
