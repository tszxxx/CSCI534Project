and now that I be here no one can ever erase 
the joy that I feel way down deep beside 
the love that I have for I will never never die 
I can see in color the first sign of spring 
the rose bud be bloom 
I get a new song new song to sing 
life look so amazing 
I never know that it could open my eye 
and for the very very first time I can see in color 
everything look beautiful sky so baby blue 
I be anxious to know where the rest of this road will go 
if April shower bring flower then I need I need more rain 
to quench the drought in I so rain on I rain on I 
I can see in color the first sign of spring 
the rose bud be bloom 
I get a new song a new song to sing 
life look so amazing 
I never know that it could open open my open my eye 
and for the very very first time I can see 
I can see in color the first sign the first sign of spring 
it look so beautiful to I 
I can see I can see I can see I can see in color 
sky so baby blue so baby blue 
I can see I can see 
I can see in color the first sign of spring 
and now the rose bud be bloom 
I can touch they I can feel they 
I be be a hold they forever and ever and ever and ever 
and ever I be a hold them ever I be a be forever 
I can see I can see I can see
