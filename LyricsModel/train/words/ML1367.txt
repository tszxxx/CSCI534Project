I know I be not suppose to hit and double back 
cause I do not get down like that 
I know I be not suppose to let she push my whip 
and stunt in front of my chick 
I be go out of my way 
to see she every day 
all of my nigga say 
but if they only know 
the thing you let I do 
they would know what I be go through 
she be worth the trouble y'all 
she ride I like I like all night so I know 
she be worth the trouble y'all 
she hold I down if it go down that be of sho 
she be worth the trouble 
get a playa actin like he be a couple 
I be not never be this deep in trouble 
there go my hustle 
it could be bad for I 
I think I be fallin in love 
I know I be not suppose to let she check my phone 
erase they other hoe 
I know I be not suppose to hit without my hat 
my momma would be mad 
I be go out of my way 
to see she every day 
all of my nigga say 
but if they only know 
the thing you let I do 
they would know what I be go through 
she be worth the trouble y'all 
she ride I like I like all night so I know 
she be worth the trouble y'all 
she hold I down if it go down that be of sho 
she be worth the trouble 
get a playa actin like he be a couple 
I be not never be this deep in trouble 
there go my hustle 
it could be bad for I 
I think I be fallin in 
can not believe the thing she get I go for 
get I like a fiend get I beggin she for more 
get I in the house while she run these street 
I do not give a damn long as she come home to I 
and she get a nigga open it be hard for I to keep my focus 
like she playin wit my mind 
I can not stand a thing she do but man I love the thing she do 
no matter what she put I though 
she be worth the trouble y'all 
she ride I like I like all night so I know

she hold I down if it go down that be of sho 
she be worth the trouble 
get a playa actin like he be a couple 
I be not never be this deep in trouble 
there go my hustle 
it could be bad for I 
I think I be fallin in love
