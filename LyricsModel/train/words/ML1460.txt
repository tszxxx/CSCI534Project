I be the thing that make you sick 
I be the blame that get place quick 
detect the crack within you lie 
I will be the wrath of you disdain 
I will be the fear in you ingrained 
become the fact that you deny 
I can feel this pain be real 
I hate deep down inside 
and like broken glass you will shatter 
with bloody fist I will batter 
like a ten ton hammer 
1 will be the trembling in you breath 
trickle of blood upon you flesh 
you would love to watch I take the fall 
I will be the thing that you despise 
cause I be the path to you demise 
and I be a be there stand tall 
I can feel this pain be real 
I hate deep down inside 
and like broken glass you will shatter 
with bloody fist I will batter 
like a ten ton hammer 
I can not stand or take another day my friend 
you could learn a thing or two 
I can feel this pain be real 
I hate deep down inside 
and like broken glass you will shatter 
with bloody fist I will batter 
like a ten ton hammer
