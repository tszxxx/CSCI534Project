One by one the stars appear
The light of the day is no longer here
[Chorus 1]
One by one the stars disappear
The sky grows brighter
Every minute of the sunrise
[Verse]
Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Got my face in the running water
Making my life so much brighter
Moon shines bright, asleep in my bed
Like so many people
Got a big day ahead of me
[Chorus 2]
Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Wouldn't miss it for all of its glory
I'll be there when you're calling me
[Chorus 3]
One by one the stars appear
The light of the day
Is no longer here
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3]
