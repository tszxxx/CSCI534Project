[Verse 1]
I did not know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face
So blind I could not see
Right behind my back you stabbed me
Should have know you were a bitch
Shut up you are making me sick
Little man you are nothing like me
Lying cheating so deceiving
I trusted you broke me down
And you screwed me over
[Chorus]
Do not try to deny it
You cannot hide it
Ill be ignited
When I get to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I want to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I want to watch you burn
You are going to get what you deserve
I want to watch you burn
[Verse 2]
You turn me inside out
My world is upside down
You are not hurt are you happy now
Looking over your shoulder fucking me over
I trusted you sold me out
This is far from over
[Chorus]
Do not try to deny it
You cannot hide it
Ill be ignited
When I get to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I want to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I want to watch you burn
Burn
I want to watch you burn
You are going to get what you deserve
You will never learn
