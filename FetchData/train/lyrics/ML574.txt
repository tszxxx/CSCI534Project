To understand the killer
I must become the killer
And I don't need this violence anymore
But now i've tasted hatred i want more
To understand the killer
I must become the killer
And I don't need this violence anymore
But now I've tasted hatred I want more
The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses
The velvet cell
And I had always thought
The desire to kill was a disease you caught
But it's dormant in the hearts of everyone
Waiting for a spark, an emotion, an emotion
The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses
The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses
The velvet cell
The velvet cell
