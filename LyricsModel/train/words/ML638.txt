I have tell you thing need to change 
you never listen or come to my aid 
the vicious cycle have not change 
my time 's spend rearrange 
motherfuck it all 
I can not stand this 
remember when I say 
everyone make I sick 
well nothing have change 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
this vicious cycle still remain 
constant clusterfuck bloodstain 
ignorance you kill for God 
expression not allow 
you fuck it up 
with you motherfucking game 
remember when I say 
I be so ashamed 
well nothing have change 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
you have to 
pick and choose you fight 
you have to 
come out of this alive 
I have tell you thing neeed to change 
you never listen or come to my aid 
the vicious cycle still not change 
my judgment fade away 
you will never change I 
remember we be through 
I be stay here 
to betray all of you 
and nothing will change 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate and I hate and I hate everyone
