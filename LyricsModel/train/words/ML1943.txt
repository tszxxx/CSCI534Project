there be someone down below blow you a kiss 
they watch from they window 
as all arm fall to they side and all eye fix 
on the death of tomorrow 
and you find everything you need 
to make a life complete 
completely revolting and they have safety and relief 
for sale up the street 
I see you in line every day 
you have time to waste and I be not sorry 
such a basket case hide the cutlery 
I have time to kill it be dead and bury 
you have get gut to spill but no one trustworthy 
these creature be wake up in these dark tree 
wait like vulture 
eye roll back turn white in time to feed 
they salivate in hunger 
for you and everything they need 
to make a death complete 
completely unnatural and salvation lie 
behind those dead eye 
that watch you while you sleep every night 
and you have time to waste and I be not sorry 
such a basket case hide the cutlery 
I have time to kill it be dead and bury 
you have get gut to spill but no one trustworthy 
you have time to waste and I be not sorry 
such a basket case hide the cutlery 
I have time to kill it be dead and bury 
you have get gut to spill but no one trustworthy
