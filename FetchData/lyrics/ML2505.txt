[Intro]
Da-dum-dum-da-da-dum-dum-da
Da-dum-dum-da-da-dum-dum-da
Da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum-da

[Chorus]
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what you do but
I love you, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, baby
[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't know what it is but you drive me crazy
And every time I'm around you, girl, it feels amazing
And I'm on my best behavior when I'm with my baby
'Cause I can't lose my baby, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I done met a lot of girls in my life but they not like you, no
I done been with the best and
Baby, you're the best of the best
You're the greatest (Oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what you do but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what you do but
I love you, oh baby
[Verse 2]
Lately, when you're gone all I do is think about my baby
I'm so gone off your loving, I don't know why
Maybe it's the way you love me, hold me, kiss me
'Cause baby, I
[Pre-Chorus]
I done met a lot of girls in my life (Yeah) but they not like you, no
I done been with the best and
Baby, you're the best of the best
You're the greatest (Oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what you do but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what you do but
I love you, oh baby
[Bridge]
Whatever it is, I'm satisfied
I don't want you to ever change
'Cause baby, you got me and that's no lie
I'ma stay right here with my baby and I don't know why
[Chorus]
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't know what you do but
I love you, I love you, I love you (And I don't know what)
I don't know what is it but
I love you, I love you, I love you (Hey)
I don't know what you do but (I don't know what you do, girl)
I love you, oh baby
