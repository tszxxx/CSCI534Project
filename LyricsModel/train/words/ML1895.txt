stand here in disarray 
a calm serenity 
the wind of change can devastate 
and it take this much for I 
with nowhere to run and no reason leave to hide 
gonna hold on 
all the wall around be break down 
now I can hear the rise sun 
surround by everything I want 
but nothing that I need 
I be blind by the absurdity 
lose all identity 
sometimes what you fear the most be what you need 
to find that road 
right around that curve a lesson learn 
now that I have the eye to see 
a hurricane a hurricane 
be sometimes the only way to wash away the pain 
a hurricane a hurricane 
be sometimes the only thing that bring you back again 
with poison toy I would isolate 
but the wind be strong and true 
but now I see where the treause be 
cause they only block my view 
I be spirale down but so oblivious 
get to find my way home 
there be a heart that bleed trap in I 
but how do I break this shell of stone 
a hurricane a hurricane 
be sometimes the only way to wash away the pain 
a hurricane a hurricane 
be sometimes the only thing that bring you back again 
sometimes I cry the tear would not fall 
and sometimes I try to break those wall 
and feel you love 
but I come alive inside 
when I finally find my way 
a hurricane a hurricane 
be sometimes the only way to wash away the pain 
a hurricane a hurricane 
be sometimes the only thing that bring you back again
