you kind of woman get to heart of stone 
but watch it break when I get you alone 
take a chance come lay down with I 
oh I want to make it 
slow and steady never lose the race 
do not stop run I be a fool for the chase 
play the game surrender to I 
baby I do not want to fake it 
be it any wonder 
you get I come under fire 
come like thunder 
you know you make I walk the wire 
it be so easy to put on a show 
you body say yes but you will not let it go 
but my passion it will not slip away 
oh I be not go crazy 
under fire 
you get I come under fire 
you get I come under fire 
oh yeah I be come under fire 
you body say yes but baby please let it go 
let it go yeah yeah 
you get I I be come my back to the wall 
no bed of rose be not no bed at all 
I be walk the wire I stumble and fall 
I get my message but I be not go to crawl 
under fire 
you get I come under fire 
you get I come under fire 
oh yeah I be come under fire
