I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight, so happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together
I can't see me loving nobody
But you for all my life
When you're with me, baby
The skies will be blue for all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you and you for me
So happy together
I can't see me loving nobody
But you for all my life
When you're with me, baby
The skies will be blue for all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you and you for me
So happy together
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you and you for me
So happy together
So happy together
How is the weather
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
