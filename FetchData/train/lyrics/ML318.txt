[Verse 1]
Well I live with snakes and lizards
And other things that go bump in the night
'Cuz to me every day is Halloween
I have given up hiding and started to fight
I have started to fight
[Verse 2]
Well any time, any place, anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say 'Why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
You look so absurd, you look so obscene'
[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
[Verse 3]
Well, I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
And I dress this way just to keep them at bay
'Cuz Halloween is every day
It's every day
[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me
I'm not the one that's so absurd
Why hide it? Why fight it?
Hurt feelings, best to stop feeling hurt
Denials, reprisals
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
[Outro]
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide...
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide...
Oh
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide...
World
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide...
World
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide...
