[Verse 1]
Day by day, we let love just walk away
And I will be the first to say, I was glad to see it go
And day by day, ever since you went away
I find that I am still missing you, and I have just got to know
[Chorus]
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
[Verse 2]
On my mind, you were right there all the time
I could search and never find someone that does me like you do
Here is the part where I am giving you my heart
I was a fool to let you go, girl, I have just got to know
[Chorus]
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
[Verse 3]
Night after night, I look to the stars
Wondering where you might be
And I have thought to myself, is that very same moon
Shining on you, like it is shining on me
[Chorus]
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
