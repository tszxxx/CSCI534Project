Mans fall a cause for my hatred 
it turn to rage and be repress inside 
to hide inside 
to strike I blind with my anger strickin with rage 
but in I a passion dwell to give all that i have 
I can no longer hide this hate for the world 
I can no longer hide this hate for what you have do 
you take you broken path but never expect I to follow 
Ill take you tired lie and shove they all back down you throat
