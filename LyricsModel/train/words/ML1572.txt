I be sing this note cause it fit in well 
with the chord I be play 
I can not pretend there be any meaning here 
or in the thing I be say 
but I be in tune 
right in tune 
I be in tune 
and I be go to tune 
right in on you 
right in on you 
right in on you 
I get a little tired of have to say 
do you come here often 
but when I look in you eye and see the harmony 
and the heartach soften 
I be get in tune 
right in tune 
I be in tune 
and I be go to tune 
right in on you 
right in on you 
right in on you 
I have get it all here in my head 
there be nothing more need to be say 
I be just bangin on my old piano 
I be get in tune to the straight and narrow 
get in tune to the straight and narrow 
yeah I be get in tune to the straight and narrow 
I be sing this note cause it fit in well 
with the way I be feel 
there be a symphony that I hear in you heart 
set be my head a-reeling 
but I be in tune 
right in tune 
I be in tune 
and I be go to tune 
right in on you 
right in on you 
right in on you 
baby with you 
baby with you 
baby with you 
baby with you 
baby with you 
I have get it all here in my head 
there be nothing more need to be say 
I be just bangin on my old piano 
I be get in tune with the straight and narrow 
get in tune to the straight and narrow
