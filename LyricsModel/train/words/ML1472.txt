when by the phone 
in vain you sit 
you very soon in you mind realize that it be not just 
a ordinary pain in you heart 
when you by chance 
go knock on she door 
walk away you be convinced that it be much more 
than just a ordinary pain in you heart 
it be more than just 
a ordinary pain in you heart 
do not fool yourself 
but tell no one else 
that it be more than just 
a ordinary pain 
in you heart 
when you catch up 
but she say goodbye 
hold back you tear and before you start to cry 
say you feel unnecessary pain in you heart 
tell she you be glad 
it be over in fact 
can she take with she the pain she bring you back 
take that ordinary pain from you heart 
it be more than just 
a ordinary pain from you heart 
do not fool yourself 
but tell no one else 
that it be more than just 
a ordinary pain 
in you heart 
you be just a masochistic fool 
because you know my love be cruel 
you never listen when they say 
do not let that girl go to you head 
but like a play boy you say no 
Or* di*nary pain 
this little girl mind you will blow 
Or* di*nary pain 
but then I blow you out the box 
Or* di*nary pain 
when I put my stuff on key and lock 
Or* di*nary pain 
it make I feel kind of sick 
Or* di*nary pain 
to know love put you in a trick 
Or* di*nary pain 
I know we love would have to end 
Or* di*nary pain 
the day I make it with you friend 
Or* di*nary pain 
give you love to one unreal 
Or* di*nary pain 
like a big fool I know you feel 
Or* di*nary pain 
but in this lovie dovie game 
Or* di*nary pain 
with all it 's joy there must be pain 
Or* di*nary pain 
but now the time have surely come 
Or* di*nary pain 
this game do not seem like so much fun 
Or* di*nary pain 
you be cry big crocodile tear 
Or* di*nary pain 
do not match the one I have cry for year 
Or* di*nary pain 
when I be home wait for you 
Or* di*nary pain 
you be out somewhere do the do 
Or* di*nary pain 
you know I would really like to stay 
Or* di*nary pain 
but like you do I have go to play 
Or* di*nary pain 
you be dumb to think I would let you be 
Or* di*nary pain 
Scott free without some pain from I 
Or* di*nary pain

Or* di*nary pain 
but to you music I can not dance 
Or* di*nary pain

Or* di*nary pain 
since one be not good enough for you 
Or* di*nary pain 
then do yourself see how you do 
Or* di*nary pain

Or* di*nary pain 
Or* di*nary pain

Or* di*nary pain 
Or* di*nary pain
