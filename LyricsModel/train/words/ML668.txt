they say you love life be in trouble in a magazine I read 
when the one you love be hangin off of he side of the bed 
baby you be just barely hangin on 
Honey I know you will soon be go 
and I do not need my palm read to know what lie ahead 
I can see you in the arm of another girl instead 
baby this be not the first time you have do it to I 
honey it be go to be the last time 
and I know you think that I will be goin out of my mind 
cry you a river that wind and wind and wind 
oh but baby I be down to my last teardrop this time 
I do not care who or what you be doin 
be not go to be no more boohooin 
baby this time I swear it be the truth 
I be not go to cry no more for you 
uh- uh 
now I know where I be goin baby I know where I be bound 
I have be rearrange chair on a ship that be goin down 
baby just step aside if you would 
honey it be really over for good 
and you might want to talk to I you might want to call 
but you will not hear nothin out of I at all 
cause baby I be not get nothin leave to say 
honey I will just be on my way 
and I know you think that I will be goin out of my mind 
cry you a river that wind and wind and wind 
oh but baby I be down to my last teardrop this time 
I do not care who or what you be doin 
be not go to be no more boohooin 
baby this time I swear it be the truth 
I be not go to cry no more for you 
and I know you that I will be goin out of my mind 
cry you a river that wind and wind and wind 
oh but baby I be down to my last teardrop 
baby I be down to my last teardrop 
baby I be down to my last teardrop this time
