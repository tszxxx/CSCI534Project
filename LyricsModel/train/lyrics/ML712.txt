[Verse 1]
We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
[Verse 2]
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire
[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
[Bridge 2]
There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire
[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
