this happen every time of year 
I do not know what to do 
when I be feelin all cheery 
and I want to give a greeting 
cuz I be in the holiday mood 
and I go scramble in my brain 
tryin to guess what they celebrate 
then I give it all up and I cover my basis 
and this be what I say well I say 
Merry Krishne
