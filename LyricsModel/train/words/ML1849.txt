go if you want to 
I never try to stop you 
know there be a reason 
for all of this you be feel 
love it be not my call 
you could not ever love I more 
you could not ever love I more 
you could not love 
I I do not show much 
it be not that hard to hide you 
see in a moment 
I can not remember how to 
be all you want 
I could not ever love you more 
I could not love you more 
I could not love 
you want I to cry and play my part 
I want you to sigh and fall apart 
we want this like everyone else 
stay if you want to 
I will always wait to hear you 
say there be a last kiss 
for all the time you run this 
Way it be not my fault 
you could not ever love I more 
you could not love I more 
you could not love I more 
I could not ever love you more 
I could not love you more 
I could not love 
you want I to lie not break you heart 
I want you to fly not stop and start 
we want we like everything else 
maybe we do not understand 
not just a boy and a girl 
it be just the end of the world 
it be just the end of the end of the world 
I I do not say much 
it be far too hard to make you 
see in a moment 
I still forget just how to 
be all you want 
I could not ever love you more 
I could not love you more 
I could not love you more 
I could not love you more 
I could not love you more
