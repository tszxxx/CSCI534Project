there will never be a spring so perfect again 
we will never see a yellow so rich 
the grass will never be quite as green 
and there will never be a kiss like you kiss 
there will never be a summer so complete 
we will never see a palette like this 
the berry will never taste as sweet 
there will never be a kiss like you kiss 
there will never be a autumn so vivid and warm 
so rare so gold and so crisp 
we will never see it color in aubergine 
there will never be a kiss like you kiss 
there will never be a winter quite so true 
when the sky be paint with gift 
and there will never be a moon so full and blue 
there will never be a kiss like you kiss 
there will never be a kiss like you kiss
