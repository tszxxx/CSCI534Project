[Verse 1]
Sometimes, when this place gets kind of empty
Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination
Under the Milky Way tonight
Lower the curtain down on Memphis
Lower the curtain down, alright
I got no time for private consultation
Under the Milky Way tonight
[Chorus]
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
[Verse 2]
And it's something quite peculiar
Something shimmering and white
It leads you here, despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight
[Chorus]
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
[Verse 2]
And it's something quite peculiar
Something shimmering and white
Leads you here, despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight
[Chorus]
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
[Outro]
Under the Milky Way tonight
Under the Milky Way tonight
Under the Milky Way tonight
