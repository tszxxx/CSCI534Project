the day turn into night 
the dog will always bite 
the serpent 's underground 
he lie without a sound 
so let the serpent sleep 
oh let the serpent sleep 
we be freeze underneath 
so let the serpent sleep 
the worm will eat the peach 
there be pebble on the beach 
the swine be in the mud 
the eagle fly above 
so let the serpent sleep 
oh let the serpent sleep 
we be freeze underneath 
so let the serpent sleep 
the ocean life and breathe 
and man create machine 
Children run away 
and night turn into day 
so let the serpent sleep 
let the serpent sleep 
we be freeze underneath 
so let the serpent sleep 
let the serpent sleep 
let the serpent sleep 
we be freeze underneath 
so let the serpent sleep
