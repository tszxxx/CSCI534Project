[Verse 1]
There must be another way
When she's gone to a better place
And loneliness will hurt you
If you can't get through the night
If every moment starts to fade
And dawn is just an hour away
I feel she's watching over
And it gets me through the night
It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd share
In many ways I'm already there
And I watch you do it
[Chorus]
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark (x4)
[Verse 2]
Another walk to take
Another lonesome evening spent without you there
And only those who hurt you
Will say patience is a virtue and it's been so long
And I can't think about it
No, I can't figure it out
Cause just how real you're feeling
Every time that you're appearing leaves no room for doubt
It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd share
In many ways I'm already there
And I watch you do it
[Chorus] x2
