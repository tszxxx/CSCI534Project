and askin you to do what you have be doin all over again

it send a shock right through I 
I can not get enough 
and if you wonder 
about the spell I be under

better than I be more than I be 
and all of this happen by takin you hand 
and who I be now be who I want to be 
and now that we be together I be stronger than ever 
I be happy and free
