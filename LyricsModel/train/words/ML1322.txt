kid 
what change you mood 
you get all sad 
so I feel sad too 
I think I know 
some thing 
you never outgrow 
you think it be wrong 
I can tell you do 
how can I explain 
when you do not want I to 
kid 
my only kid 
you look so small 
you have go so quiet 
I know you know 
what I be about 
I will not deny it 
but you forget 
you do not understand 
you have turn you head 
you have drop my hand 
all my sorrow 
all my blue 
all my sorrow 
shut the light 
go away 
full of grace 
you cover you face 
kid 
precious kid 
you eye be blue 
but you will not cry I know 
angry tear 
be too dear 
you will not let they go
