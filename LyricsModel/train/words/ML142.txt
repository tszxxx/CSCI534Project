Revvin up you engine 
listen to she howlin roar 
Metal under tension 
beggin you to touch and go 
highway to the Danger Zone 
ride into the Danger Zone 
headin into twilight 
Spreadin out she wing tonight 
she get you jumpin off the deck 
and shovin into overdrive 
highway to the Danger Zone 
I will take you right into the Danger Zone 
you will never say hello to you 
until you get it on the red line overload 
you will never know what you can do 
until you get it up as high as you can go 
out along the edge 
always where I burn to be 
the further on the edge 
the hotter the intensity 
highway to the Danger Zone 
go to take it right into the Danger Zone 
highway to the Danger Zone 
ride into the Danger Zone 
highway to the Danger Zone 
go to take it right into the Danger Zone 
highway to the Danger Zone 
ride into the Danger Zone
