never see a sun shine like this 
never see the moon glow like this 
never see the waterfall like this 
never see the light off like this 
never dug anyone like this 
never have tasty lip to kiss 
never have someone to miss 
never write a song quite like this 
fortunate to have you girl 
I be so glad you be in my world 
just as sure as the sky be blue 
I bless the day that I find you 
never have room service all night 
never take a trip first class flight 
never have a love affair so tight 
I have never feel a feeling so right 
never see a winter so white 
never have word to recite 
never have a flame to ignite 
and I never sang a song with all my might 
silence child hope you hear 
I be callin out to you body 
baby you know just what to do 
close the door no interlude
