[Verse 1]
Prettier than all the world
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
You're only one fellow's girl
Oh, and I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
[Bridge]
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
[Verse 2]
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud girl (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
Complements to you from all the people we meet
Yes and I'm so proud now (I'm so proud)
Believe me I love you too
I'm so proud of being loved by you
[Instrumental interlude]
[Hook / Bridge]
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
[Verse 2 abbreviated]
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah and I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of bein loved by you
