as I breathe this cold that confines I 
it be I who hope to bring light 
to this valley of death 
behind the shadow of lie 
brilliant beam converge now to blind I 
I can not feel shame nor regret 
but in the presence of death 
when the vulture arrive 
slave you time of descent will come with we all 
pain the way of all flesh that wither to old 
all that you dream will be forget 
and burn with the kindr of soul 
I be the seed who have begotten 
to rot with the waste of this earth down below 
now burn with the kindr of soul 
you hope have now aged and wither away 
all that you dream will be forget 
and burn with the kindr of soul 
I be the seed who have begotten 
to rot with the waste of this earth down below
