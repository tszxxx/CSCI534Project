it be a morning long before daw and 
without a warning I find he be go 
how could he do it 
why should he do it 
he never do it before 
be I blue 
be I blue 
be not these tear in these eye tell you 
how can you ask I be I blue 
why would not you be too 
if each plan 
with you man 
do fall through 
there be a time 
when I be he only one 
but now I be 
the sad and lonely one lonely 
be I gay 
untill today 
now he be go and we be through 
be I blue
