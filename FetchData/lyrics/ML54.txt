[Verse 1]
My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You've turned this lie to truth
[Chorus]
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
[Verse 2]
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
[Chorus]
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
[Verse 3]
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
[Outro]
Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
