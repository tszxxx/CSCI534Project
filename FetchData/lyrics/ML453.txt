[Chorus]
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
[Verse]
When you're laying so close to me
There's no place
I'd rather you be than with me
[Chorus]
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
[Verse]
Do it to me again and again
You put me in such a awful spin
In a spin, in-uh
[Chorus]
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
[Verse]
Lay your head down real close to me
Soothe my mind and set me free
Set me free, uh
[Chorus]
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
[Verse]
When you're laying so close to me
There's no place
I'd rather you be than with me
[Chorus]
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
[Verse]
Do it to me again and again
You put me in such a awful spin
In a spin, in-uh
[Chorus]
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
