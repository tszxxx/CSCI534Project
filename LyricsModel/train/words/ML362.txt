there be a big brown cloud in the city 
and the countryside be a sin 
and the price of life be to high to give up 
get to come down again 
when the world wide war be over and do 
and the dream of peace come true 
we will all be drink that free bubble up 
and eat that rainbow stew 
when they find out how to burn water 
and the gasoline car be go 
when a airplane fly without any fuel 
and sunlight heat we home 
one of these day when the air clear up 
and the sun come shine through 
we will all be drink that free bubble up 
and eat that rainbow stew 
eat rainbow stew with a silver spoon 
underneath that sky of blue 
we will all be drink that free bubble up 
and eat that rainbow stew 
you do not have to get high to be happy 
just think about what be in store 
when people start do what they oughta to be do 
they will not be booe no more 
when a president go through the white house door 
and do what he say he will do
