when the morning sun streak across my room 
and I be wakin up from another dream of you 
yes you know I be on the road once again it seem 
all that be leave behind be a chain of broken dream 
but you know that I love you 
you know that I love you 
oh I love you 
and how I wish that love be all we would need to live 
what a life we would have cause I have get so much to give 
but you know I feel so sad down inside my heart 
that the dollar sign should be keep we apart 
but you know that I love you 
you know that I love you 
oh how I love you 
and if only I could find my way back to the time 
when the problem of this life have not yet cross my mind 
and the answer could be find in child 's nursery rhyme 
I would come run back to you I would come run back to you 
but you know we can not live on dream alone 
get to pay the rent so I must leave you all alone 
cause you know I make my choice many year ago 
and now this traveling life well it be the only life I know 
but you know that I love you 
you know that I love you 
oh I love you 
but you know that I love you 
you know that I love you 
oh how I love you 
but you know that I love you 
you know that I love you 
oh how I love you 
but you know I love you 
but you know I love you 
oh I love you 
but you know that I love you 
you know that I love you 
oh how I love you
