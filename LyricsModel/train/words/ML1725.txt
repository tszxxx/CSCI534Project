when the wagon leave the city 
for the forest and further on 
paint wagon of the morning 
dusty road where they have go 
sometimes travelin through the darkness 
at the summer comin home 
foreign face by the wayside 
look as if they have not know and 
all the sad be in they eye 
and the desert that be dry 
in a country town 
where the map be find 
oh the dancing and the singing 
oh the music when they play 
oh the fire that they see there 
on the grave of no return 
sometimes they find it 
sometimes they keep it 
often lose in on the way 
Pawnee shadow to possess he 
sometimes ride inside of day 
oh the sad be in they eye 
and the desert that be dry 
in a country town 
where the map be find 
oh the sad be in they eye 
and the desert that be dry 
in a country town 
where the wagon bound
