[Intro]
Baby, ooh baby
When we
[Verse 1]
I gotta man to love me down all night
I just hate it when we fuss and fight
Sometimes it's hard for us to get along
But I miss him when he's not home
Nobody ever finds the perfect man
But I'm a make the best with what I have
Reminiscing on when we touch
Boy, we make good love
[Chorus]
When we (When we)
When we (Oh, when we, baby)
When we (When we, when we)
When we make good love
When we (When we)
When we (when we)
When we (Oh, when we, baby)
When we make good love
[Verse 2]
We've been together for three long years
But I know I've cried meany tears
Over something that I can't control
But I love him with all my soul
Nobody ever made me feel this way
We're gonna make it through the good and bad days
I know you'll always choose what's best for us
'Cause we make good love...
[Chorus]
When we (When we)
When we (Oh, when we, baby)
When we (Oh, when we)
When we make good love
When we (When, when, when, when, when we)
When we (When we)
When we (Oh, when we, baby)
When we make good love
[Bridge]
Boy, you make me realize
That you're that special one in my life
You're my soulmate sent to me
And ain't nobody gonna be
As good to you as I can be
I will love you faithfully
'Cause our love was meant to be
'Cause we make good love
[Chorus]
When we (When we)
When we (Oh, when we, when we, baby)
When we (When we make good love, good love, good love)
When we make good love
[Bridge over Chorus]
Boy, you make me realize

And ain't no, ain't nobody gonna be
Be as good to you as I can be
