[Verse 1]
When I was a boy
I did not care about a thing
It was me and this world and a broken dream
I was blaming myself
For all that was going wrong
I was way out there
On the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved
I started pushing them out
Then I realized
That it was all my fault
[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
[Verse 2]
So I put out my hand
And I asked for some help
We tore down the walls I built around myself
I was struck by the light
Then I fell to the ground
[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there?
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I am drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
[Bridge]
You know a heart of gold
Will not take you all the way
And in a world so cold
It is hard to keep the faith
I'm never going to fade away!
[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline (looking for a lifeline)
For what seems like a lifetime (seems like a lifetime)
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there? (Is there anybody out there?)
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline
