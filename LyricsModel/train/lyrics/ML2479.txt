I could be a smack freak and hate society
I could hate God and blame Dad
I might be in a Holocaust, hate Hitler
Might not have a child and hate school
I could be a sad lover and hate death
I could be a neuro and hate sweat
No
I hate my way
I make you into a song
I can't rise above the church
I'm caught in a jungle, vines tangle my hands
I'm always so hot and it's hot in here
I say it's all right
My pillow screams, too
But so does my kitchen
And water and my shoes
And the road
I have a gun in my head
I'm invisible
I can't find the ice
A slug
I'm TV
I hate
A boy was tangled in his bike forever
A girl was missing two fingers
Gerry Ann was confused
Mr. Huberty had a gun in his head
So I sit up late in the morning and ask myself again
How do they kill children?
And why do I want to die?
They can no longer move
I can no longer be still
I hate my way
