[Verse 1]
They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
[Verse 2]
I know they say that it's such a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life
[Chorus]
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our hearts' celebration
I love you - you know I love you too
Real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destination
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
[Verse 3]
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up
[Verse 4]
Oh, you and I, we must be dreamers
Because we're making all our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never, ever get enough
[Chorus]
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our hearts' celebration
I love you - you know I love you too
We got real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destination
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We got real love
[Chorus]
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our hearts' celebration
I love you - you know I love you too
Real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destination
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our hearts' celebration
I love you - you know I love you too
We got real love, not an imitation
Real love
