Blue ain't just a word
It's a feeling
A feeling of loneliness
That I can feel right now
Love has looked at me
But tried to change me
I wished that love would take me just for what I am
Just for what I am I want someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me
To feel like that old memory
Just for what they see just for being me
I want someone to love me just for what I am
Cry ain't just a sound
It's a sadness
A sadness that lives with me
And follows me around
Love wants me to be someone I can't be
I wished that love would take me just for what I am
Just for what I am...
I want someone to love me just for what I am
