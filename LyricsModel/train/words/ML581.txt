I see tree of green red rose too 
I see they bloom for I and you 
and I think to myself 
what a wonderful world 
I see sky of blue and cloud of white 
the bright bless day the dark sacred night 
and I think to myself 
what a wonderful world 
the colour of the rainbow 
so pretty in the sky 
I also and the face by people pass by 
I see friend shake hand say how do you do 
they be really say I love you 
I hear baby cry they watch they grow 
they learn much more they will never know 
and I think to myself 
what a wonderful world 
yes I think to myself 
what a wonderful world 
I see friend shake hand 
say how do you do 
they be really say I love you 
I hear baby cry 
they watch they grow 
they learn much more 
they will never know 
and I think to myself 
what a wonderful world 
yes I think to myself 
what a wonderful world
