[Chorus 1]
We have love
We have love
We have love
We have love
[Chorus 2]
We have love, give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of
We have lost nothing
Keep that thought firm in your mind
When you look but you don't find
What you can offer
We have lost nothing
I keep that thought firm in my mind
When I look but I don't find
What I can offer
I don't always know
What it is you mean to show
But I keep it close to mine
And we discover
[Chorus 2] [x2]
[Chorus 1]
I thought my heart was damaged
I thought my heart was strong
A thought is nothing damaged
A thought is nothing wrong
I see it in my care for you
I see it in my care for you
We have love
(I see it in my care for you)
Give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of
(I see it in my care for you)
We have love
(I see it in my care for you)
Give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of
(I see it in my care for you)
