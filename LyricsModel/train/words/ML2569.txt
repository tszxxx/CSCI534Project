I walk into the kitchen 
the silverware be go 
the furniture be missing 
I guess you get it all uh huh 
this be where it ought to hurt 
seem like every time you leave I 
you try to think of something worse 
I can not even get the blue no more 
I try to worry like I do before 
and nothing happen when I walk the floor 
so what be I suppose to do 
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep 
I be go under but it be not too deep 
you want to hurt I but it be just no use 
I can not even get the blue 
well this time be no different 
the sun 's up in the sky 
sit on the back porch 
cloud be roll by 
oh this be where it ought to rain 
but it do not really matter 
to I it be all about the same
