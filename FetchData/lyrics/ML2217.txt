[Verse 1]
What good is the dawn
That grows into day
The sunset at night
Or living this way
[Chorus]
For I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me at night
(Within me at night)
[Verse 2]
The love of my life
She left me one day
I cried when she said
"I don't feel the same way"
[Chorus]
Still I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me tonight
(Within me tonight)
[Verse 3]
I'll dream of her arms
And though they're not real
Just like she's still there
The way that I feel
[Chorus]
My love's like the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
It won't ever die
(It won't ever die)
