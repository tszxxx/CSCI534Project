[Verse 1]
You can give me money, diamonds and pearls
But you can't buy my love with all the money in the world
[Chorus]
You can't buy my love
No you can't buy my love
For no money in the world
You can't buy my love
[Verse 2]
Now you're so blue
Baby I'm so glad
Cause you done lost
The best thing you ever had
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
[Chorus]
