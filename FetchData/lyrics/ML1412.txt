I could while away the hours
Conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain;
Well, my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain

I'd unravel ev'ry riddle
For ev'ry individdle
In trouble or in pain

With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain

Oh I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore,
I would think of things
I never thought before,
And then I'd sit--
And think some more

I would not be just a nuthin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain;
I would dance and be merry,
Life would be a ding-a-derry
If I only had a brain.
