[Verse 1]
This is the death of me
I feel it constantly
Just like an enemy
That wants to see me bleed
[Pre-Chorus]
So I try to be silent, but my words, they explode like hand grenades
I just gotta stay calm, before I let this time bomb blow up in my face
[Chorus]
These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
[Verse 2]
The hounds of Hell, they cry
That's how they get me
Inject my head with lies
The pain's astonishing
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a brick or stone
Slowly crushing my bones
Sendin' me to my grave
And it's just a fake
This life that I made
I'm going insane
[Chorus]
These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
Issues!
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
Issues! (They choke me like a noose)
Issues!
They choke me like a noose
