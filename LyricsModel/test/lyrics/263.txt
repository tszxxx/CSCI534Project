You were the owner of a broken heart
You didn't know that I was falling in love from afar
Every morning, wiping tears from your eyes
You never dreamed someone was watching and heard every cry
What are the odds of a fool finding in love
It's a one in a million shot in the dark
Just when I thought there's no need holdin' on..
You wrapped me in your arms and took me on a stairway to love..
And that's where you'll find true emotion, dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love..stairway to love
A little candlelight, a fire for two
A glass of chardonnay bring out the lover in you
So dancing through the night makes a picture so right
Two silhouettes framed as one in the moonlight
What are the odds of a fool finding in love
It's a one in a million shot in the dark
Just when I thought there's no need holdin on..
You wrapped me in your arms and took me on a stairway to love..
And that's where you'll find true emotion, dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love..stairway to love
Are you ready?
We can fly away right now to Tahiti
Pack your bags. Whatever you want
You can have, here on the stairway to love..
It's where you'll find true emotion, dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love..stairway to love
