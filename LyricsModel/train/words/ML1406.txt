I be really close tonight 
and I feel like I be move inside she 
lie in the dark 
and I think that I be begin to know she 
let it go 
I will be there when you call 
and whenever I fall at you foot 
you let you tear rain down on I 
whenever I touch you slow turn pain 
you be hide from I now 
there be something in the way that you be talk 
the word do not sound right 
but I hear they all move inside you 
know 
I will be wait when you call 
hey whenever I fall at you foot 
will not you let you tear rain down on I 
whenever I touch you slow turn pain 
the finger of blame have turn upon itself 
and I be more than willing to offer myself 
do you want my presence or need my help 
who know where that might lead 
I fall 
whenever I fall at you foot 
will not you let you tear rain down on I 
whenever I fall 
whenever I fall
