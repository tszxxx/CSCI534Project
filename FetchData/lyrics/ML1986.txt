[Instrumental Intro]
Thousands of soldiers march to their fate
Lambs to the slaughter, certain death awaits
Trapped on a field littered with bones
Tear into the fallen lying below
Now you march forwards to die
Ten million bodies piled high
Mechanized engines of war spitting lead
Horrors of battle fill you with dread
Bombs are falling, death is calling
Fire raining from the sky
Walked over corpses of a thousand men
Who fall without a reason why
Now, call upon gods of death
Fight - awaken all your rage
Launch the attack, no turning back
Charge - your destiny awaits
The order is given, over the top
Scream - for you, it is too late
We'll give you what you've been waiting for
Total war!
[Instrumental Break]
Bombs are falling, death is calling
Fire raining from the sky
Walked over corpses of a thousand men
Who fall without a reason why
Call upon gods of death
Fight - awaken all your rage
Launch the attack, no turning back
Charge - your destiny awaits
The order is given, over the top
Scream - for you, it is too late
We'll give you what you've been waiting for
Total war!
[Instrumental Break]
Not ready to die, though your time will come tonight
Total war!
The battle continues, will you ever win the fight?
Total war!
All the life that was in you, now is gone
Total war!
The battle's over, but the war rages on
Total war!
