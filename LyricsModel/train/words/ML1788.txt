I want to go where the warm wind blow I 
I just want to ease my mind 
I want to run through the sand and the sun 
leavin it all behind 
watch that ol moon risin on the horizon 
turnin from gold to blue 
it be just makin it easy for takin it easy with you 
somewhere far away those night bird call my name 
I can hear they sing love song just for I and you 
for a million summer night this dream have be the same 
it be just you and I and the star and the sand and the sea 
I want to go where the warm wind blow I 
I just want to ease my mind 
I want to run through the sand and the sun 
leavin it all behind 
watch that ol moon risin on the horizon 
turnin from gold to blue 
ooh it be just makin it easy for takin it easy with you 
every time I look into you emerald eye 
I just want to take you far away 
cause I know you deserve to live in paradise 
and babe you know I will get you there someday 
cause I want to go where the warm wind blow I 
I just want to ease my mind 
I want to run through the sand and the sun 
leavin it all behind 
watch that ol moon risin on the horizon 
turnin from gold to blue 
it be just makin it easy for takin it easy with you 
I want to go where the warm wind blow I 
I just want to ease my mind 
I want to run through the sand and the sun 
leavin it all behind
