[Intro]
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people, right on
[Verse 1]
Say you want a revolution
We better get on right away
Well you get on your feet
And into the street
[Chorus]
Singing power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people, right on
[Verse 2]
A million workers working for nothing
You better give them what they really own
We got to put you down
When we come into town
[Chorus]
Singing power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people, right on
[Verse 3]
I got to ask you comrades and brothers
How do you treat you own woman back home
She got to be herself
So she can free herself
[Chorus][x3]
Singing power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people, right on
Now, now, now, now
[Outro]
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people
Power to the people, right on
