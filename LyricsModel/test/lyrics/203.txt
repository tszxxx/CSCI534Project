[Verse 1]
Breeze still carries the sound
Maybe I'll disappear
Tracks will fade in the snow
You won't find me here
[Verse 2]
Ice is starting to form
Ending what had begun
I am locked in my head
With what I've done
I know you tried to rescue me
Didn't let anyone get in
Left with a trace of all that was
And all that could have been
[Chorus 1]
Please
Take this
And run far away
Far away from me
I am tainted
The two of us
Were never meant to be
All these pieces
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing
You meant everything
Everything to me
[Verse 3]
Gone, fading
Everything
And all that
Could have been
Could have been
[Chorus 2]
Please
Take this
And run far away
Far as you can see
I am tainted
And happiness
And peace-of-mind
Were never meant for me
All these pieces
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing
You meant everything
Everything to me
