stand with my enemy 
hang on my horn 
with haste and reverie 
kill with charm 
only happy when you hurt 
only deadly in a swarm 
only healthy in the dirt 
only empty in you arm 
I play I be sick and tame 
draw the horde 
I wait and show the lame 
the meaning of harm 
the skull beneath my foot 
like feather in sand 
I graze among the grave 
a feeling of peace 
only bending when you break 
only feeding when you be cold 
only healing when you ache 
only feeling when you do not 
only bending when you break 
only feeding when you be cold 
only healing when you ache 
only feeling when you do not
