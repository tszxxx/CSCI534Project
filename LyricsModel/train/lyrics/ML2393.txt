[Verse 1]
Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum it's the sound
[Chorus 1]
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
[Verse 2]
They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
[Chorus 2]
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her 
dog day
's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under the lightning and
The 
thunder knew that someone had to stop the rain
[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away run away from the pain yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away
[Chorus 2]
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
[Verse 2]
What did her daddy do?
It's Janie's last I.O.U
She had to take him down easy and put a bullet in his brain
She said cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same
[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Run away run away from the pain yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Now everybody is on the run
[Outro]
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run (Honey honey, what's the problem?)
Because Janie's got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)
Janie's got a gun (Was it Daddy's cradle robbing that)
Her dog day's just begun (Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun
