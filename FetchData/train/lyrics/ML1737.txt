Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your present to your darlin' from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Oh, Oh pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Crowded streets, busy feet hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by
Should you stop?
Better not, much to busy
You'd better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your present to your darlin' from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Oh, Oh pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Oh, Oh pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue...
