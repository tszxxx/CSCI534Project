record and clothes on the floor 
remind I of the night before 
a pounding pain in my head 
I think I will spend all day in bed 
a thousand cigarette go nut 
the stranger 's hand in mine go white 
smudge lipstick feeling sick 
make out fall out make up 
make out fall out make up fall out 
dance in the living room 
with light supply by the moon 
thing I have say but should not 
trick I have try but could not 
sorry if the music be too loud 
now the air be thicker than the cloud 
do I really call you 
I be look for someone I know 
make out fall out make up fall out 
fall out make up fall out
