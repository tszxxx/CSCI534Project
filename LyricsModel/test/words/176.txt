they ask I how I feel and if my love be real and how I know I will make it through and they , they look at I and frow they would like to drive I from this town they do not want I around because I believe in you they , they show I to the door they say , " do not come back no more " because I do not be like they would like I to and I , I walk out on my own a thousand mile from home but I do not feel alone because I believe in you I will believe in you even through the tear and the laughter I will believe in you even though we be apart I will believe in you even on the morning after oh , when the dawn be near oh , when the night be disappearing oh , this feeling be still here in my heart do not let I drift too far keep I where you be where I will always be renew and that which you have give I today be worth more than I could pay and no matter what they say I believe in you I will believe in you when winter turn to summer I will believe in you when white turn to black I will believe in you even though I be outnumber oh , though the earth may shake I oh , though my friend forsake I oh , even that could not make I go back do not let I change my heart keep I set apart from all the plan they do pursue and I , I do not mind the pain do not mind the drive rain I know I will sustain because I believe in you
