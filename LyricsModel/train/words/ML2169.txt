I use to think that I be happy 
but I be just lie to myself 
make I believe no one would have I 
so I put my poor heart on the shelf 
like a heatwave 
like a sud- den wind 
like a slap to the essence of my being 
Boy you come in like a sud den wind 
you know you blow I away 
away 
will you love I 
will you be the one 
who be come come to my rescue 
will you care for I 
will you comfort I 
will you be the one 
the one who be go to rescue I 
I feel like I be bear just for you 
I be so glad you come in time 
now that you here 
I just adore you baby 
to lose this love would be a crime 
like a heatwave 
like a sud- den wind 
like a slap to the essence of my being 
Boy you come in like a sud den wind 
you know you blow I away 
away 
will you love I 
will you be the one 
who be come come to my rescue 
will you care for I 
will you com fort I 
will you be the one 
the one who be go to rescue I 
will you love I 
will you be the one 
who be come come to my rescue 
will you care for I 
will you com fort I 
will you be the one 
the one who be go to rescue I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you love I 
will you be the one 
who be come come to my rescue 
will you care for I 
will you com fort I 
will you be the one 
the one who be go to rescue I
