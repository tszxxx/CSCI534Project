Late One Night I Heard a Knock on my door
To Know Surprise it was my Landlord
He Notified me I was late with the rent
What Can Ya Do With Your Last Dollar Spent
Ya Got Trouble, Some Kind Of Trouble
I Called UP My Baby for a Little Advice
Because My Sugar Baby Always Treats Me So Nice
I Had A Funny Feeling he wasn't alone
When i Heard another voice whisper "hang up the phone"
I got Trouble, Some Kind of Trouble
Trouble in My Heart, Trouble on my mind, Never Any Trouble for me to find some kind of Trouble
I Went to my Boss Said I need I Little Time
To Work on This poor Broken Heart of Mine
He Said I'd Like To Help Ya I've Been Their Before but the Problem is Girl
Ya Don't Work here no more
Ya Got Trouble, Some Kind of Trouble
Trouble in My Heart, Trouble on my mind, Never Any Trouble for me to find some kind of Trouble
I Got Trouble
Well I Was Down Around As Low As a Body Can Be
So I Talked to my Preacher about Praying for Me
He Smiled and he said child your not alone
Because all gods children got to deal with their own Trouble
Some Kind Of trouble
Trouble in My Heart, Trouble on my mind, Never Any Trouble for me to find some kind of Trouble
Some Kind Of Trouble
Some Kind of Trouble
Trouble in My Heart, Trouble on my mind, Never Any Trouble for me to find some kind of Trouble
TROUBLE
