picture sunrise 
picture moon glow 
love do you know 
nature have she way with you with you 
eye of fire 
line of laughter 
it be no wonder 
nature have she way with you with you 
extension of each other 
bear to one another 
extension of each other 
bear to one another in love 
bear to one another in love 
bear to one another in love
