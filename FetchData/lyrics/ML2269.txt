[Verse 1]
Johnny's in America
, 
Lo-Teks at the wheel
No one needs anyone, they don't even just pretend
Johnny's in America
[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
Johnny's in America
[Verse 2]
Johnny wants a plane
, Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman, Johnny wants to think of a joke
Johnny's in America
[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
Johnny's in America
[Verse 3]
Johnny's in America
, Johnny looks up at the stars
Johnny combs his hair and Johnny wants pussy and cars
Johnny's in America
Johnny's in America
[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
[Interlude]
God is an American
God is an American
[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Yeah, I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
[Outro]
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American
