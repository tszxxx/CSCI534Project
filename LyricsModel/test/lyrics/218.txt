[Verse 1: Martin Ain]
All is cold and frozen
Frozen the sea
Frozen the sky
Frozen is death
But I cannot die
Cannot die
[Verse 2: Martin Ain]
As the snow falls
To cover this all
And all is cold
And cold, cold is all
All is cold, cold is all
[Pre-Chorus: Martin Ain]
Cold
Frozen
Frozen is heaven and frozen is hell
And I am dying in this living human shell
[Chorus: Martin Ain]
I am a dying God coming into human flesh
I am a dying God coming into human flesh
I am a dying God coming into human flesh
I am a dying God
[Verse 3: Martin Ain]
Frozen my heart
Frozen my soul
Frozen my love
[Chorus (Extended): Tom G. Warrior]
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
