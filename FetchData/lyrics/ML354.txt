[Verse 1]
Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him a-drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine
Singin'
[Chorus]
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
[Verse 2]
If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you
Sing it now
[Chorus]
(Joy) to the world
(All) the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
(Joy to you and me)
[Verse 3]
You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier
 and 
a rainbow rider
 (ha ha ha)
And a straight-shooting son of a gun
 (alright)
I said a 
straight shootin' (son of a gun)
[Chorus]
