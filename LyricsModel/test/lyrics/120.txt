[Verse 1]
The time to rise has been engaged
You'd better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone
I listen to the finest worksong
[Chorus]
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
[Verse 2]
Another chance has been engaged
To throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time
I beg you not beg to rhyme
[Chorus]
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
[Verse 3]
Take your instinct by the reins
You'd better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
[Chorus]
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
[Verse 4]
Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
[Chorus]
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
[Outro]
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
