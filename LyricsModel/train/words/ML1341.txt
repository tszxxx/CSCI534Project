you hand on he arm 
haystack charm around you neck 
string out and thin 
call some friend try to cash some check 
he be act dumb 
that be what you have come to expect 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
he be wear you clothes 
head down to toe a reaction to you 
you say you know what he do 
but you id iot kid 
you do not have a clue 
sometimes they just get catch in the eye 
you be pull he through 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
now on the bus 
nearly touch this dirty retreat 
fall out 
6th and Powell a dead sweat in my tooth 
gonna walk walk walk 
four more block plus the one in my brain 
down downstairs to the man 
he be go to make it all okay 
I can not be myself 
I can not be myself and I do not want to talk 
I be take the cure so I can be quiet wherever I want 
so leave I alone 
you ought to be proud that I be get good mark 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay 
needle in the hay
