he leave he cigarette 
how long before they be stale 
I still smell he on my sheet 
I linger in the memory 
he say he be never be in love 
and do not know what love mean 
so I tell he so I tell he 
to love be to release 
fear lead nowhere 
fear lead nowhere 
it be easier to love than not to love 
aah aah 
he leave he cigarette 
how long before they be stale 
I can not take much more of this 
I linger in this emptiness 
he say he be not ready for this 
and do not know if he will be 
so I tell he so I tell he 
to love be to release 
fear lead nowhere 
fear lead nowhere 
fear lead nowhere 
fear lead nowhere 
it be easier to love than not to love 
it be easier to love to love to love to love 
it be easier to love than not to love 
it be easier to love to love 
let I love you 
let I love you 
let I love you 
let I love you 
it be easier to love than not to love 
it be easier to love to love to love to love 
it be easier to love than not to love 
it be easier to love 
release release
