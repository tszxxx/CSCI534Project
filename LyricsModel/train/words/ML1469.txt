I want to go to the sun 
hold my life like I have never do 
but it be just the devil in I 
the devil that be call as I come undone 
the sky be get dark tonight 
darker than the fear that be go to pull we apart 
the beating be the sound of love 
the sound of love be beat like a fevered heart 
and it be the fire the fire the fire 
it be heavenly heavenly 
desire desire 
desire desire 
I want to lay in the dust 
the dust be go to fall here when I lie 
God know it be just the devil in I 
the devil that be take my hand to the fire 
I never want to leave you now 
leave you like the sun be go to disappear 
but it be just believe now 
believe in my heart be what I have come to fear 
and it be the fire the fire the fire 
it be heavenly heavenly 
desire desire 
desire desire 
I have get desire desire 
I have get desire desire 
and only the lonely 
only the lonely fall 
only the lonely 
only the lonely fall 
fall 
oh and I go to the fire 
but God know it be the sound of it be the sound of love 
it be the beat of my heart that you 
finally beat it be come come come for you 
and it be just the devil in I 
it be just a door to the devil gather in disguise 
take I by the hand 
and lead I lead I off to the fire 
and it be the fire the fire the fire 
it be heavenly heavenly 
desire desire
