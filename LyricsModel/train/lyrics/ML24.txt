Been in love so many times before
Everyone I loved walked right out the door
But I never knew that I'd
Find someone like you
Take me by the hand
And help me to stand
I never knew that I'd find someone
Chorus:
Give me unconditional love (repeat 3 times)
Vamp:
Love me right
Hold me tight
Lord I love you
Lord I love you
