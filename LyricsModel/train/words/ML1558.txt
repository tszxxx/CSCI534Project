you can drive around all night 
with the radio on high 
and wonder what it be like to be like 
and never feel out of time 
you be not the only one you be just my only one 
even in dream I could not betray you 
if I could shut my eye 
and disconnect my mind 
there be just one thought I have think 
I have think it all the time 
you be not the only one you be just my only one 
even in dream I could not betray you 
cuz there be nobody like you 
be that why they do not like you 
you be cold and dead to they joke 
yeah there be nobody like you 
be that why they do not like you 
like I do 
and I do 
even in dream I could not betray you 
even in dream I could not betray you 
betray you 
even in dream I could not betray you 
even in dream I could not betray you 
betray you
