I can hear she heartbeat 
from a thousand mile 
hear the heaven open 
every time she smile 
and when I come to she 
that be where I belong 
yet I be run to she 
like a river strong 
she give I love love love love crazy love 
she give I love love love love crazy love 
she be get a fine sense of humor 
when I be feel low down 
and when I come to she 
when the sun go down 
take my trouble away 
take away my grief 
take away my heartache 
in the night like a thief 
she give I love love love love crazy love 
she give I love love love love crazy love 
yes I need yes I need she in the daytime 
and oh I need yes I need she in the night 
I want to throw my arm all around she 
to kiss and hug and kiss and hug she tight 
and oh 
and when I be return 
from so far away 
she give I sweet sweet lovin 
brighten up my day 
it make I righteous 
and it make I whole 
make I mellow 
down into my soul 
she give I love love love love crazy love 
she give I love love love crazy love 
one more time she give love just a little love 
when I wake up in the morning 
she give I love love love 
crazy love
