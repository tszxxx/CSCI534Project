[Verse]
Do you, do you want to bleed?
Do you, do you want to live in vain?
It's only life
She's so afraid to kiss
And so afraid to laugh
Is she running from her past?
It's only life
She's so afraid of love
Is so afraid of hate
What's she running from now?
Do you, do you want to scream?
Do you, do you want to face the strange?
Do you, do you believe?
Are you, are you afraid of change?
It's only life
She's so afraid of this
And so afraid to ask
She hides behind her mask
Nothing's ever right
She's so afraid of pain
So afraid of blame
It's driving her insane
So insecure
There is no cure
Well she's so afraid
She's so afraid of death
She's so afraid, afraid of life
The drama in her head
Getting louder all the time
Getting louder all the time
She's so afraid, afraid to lose
Been so afraid of fame
Everyday she feels the same
[Bridge]
It's driven her insane
It's driven her
It's drive
It's
[Outro]
Another broken pretty thing
