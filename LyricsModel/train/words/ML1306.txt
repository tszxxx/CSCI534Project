oh Matilda it be I who take the pill 
that kill you 
oh sweet Matilda I take that pill 
and wash it down the water 
and I hit the town that very night 
oh sweet Matilda I be not ready 
be not ready for you 
oh sweet sweet Matilda I take that pill 
and wash it down with water 
it smelt so sweet but it make I sick 
be you lonely now 
now you have swallow I down
