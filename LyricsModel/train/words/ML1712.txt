Christmas just be not Christmas 
without the one you love 
New year just be not New Years 
without the one you love 
underneath the mistletoe 
I see a face all aglow 
last year this time 
now I be stay home alone 
and my house be not a home 
without that girl of mine 
Christmas just be not Christmas 
without the one you love 
and New year just be not New Years 
without the one you love 
twelve o'clock and all be well 
and I be do oh so swell 
last year this time 
goin shopping with friend together 
make vow to leave each other never 
it be a waste of time 
Christmas just be not Christmas 
without the one you love 
New year just be not New Years 
without the one you love 
Christmas just be not Christmas 
without the one you love 
New year just be not New Years 
without the one you love 
Christmas just be not Christmas 
without the one you love 
New year just be not New Years 
without the one you love 
Christmas just be not Christmas 
without the one you love
