the darkness bleed its violent sigh 
and purge from within 
death it hold you in its arm 
and kiss you goodnight 
oh oh oh the darkness come 
oh oh oh i feel it be bite 
it purge from within 
it be over it be over this haunting be over 
they cut my wrist and watch I bleed 
inside a dream 
and over and over this haunting be over 
they cut my wrist and watch I bleed 
they stop haunt I 
darkness bleed its violent sigh 
and purge from within 
death it hold you in its arm 
and kiss you goodnight
