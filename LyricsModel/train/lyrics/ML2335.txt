[Verse 1]
In the middle of a gunfight, in the center of a restaurant
They say, "Come with your arms raised high!"
Well, they're never gonna get me like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your
Faith in me
Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a
Prayer, say a prayer
[Chorus]
Now, but I can't
And I don't know how we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't
Well, I can!
Too much, too late or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips
Again
[Verse 2]
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate'sâ€‹ a killer, 
they make me do push-ups
In drag, 
but nobody cares
If you're losing yourself, am I losing myself?
Well, I miss my mom! Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope, if you dare?
And nobody knows
All the trouble I've seen
[Chorus]
Now, but I can't
And I don't know how we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't
Well, I can!
Too much, too late or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips
Again
[Bridge]
To your room
What they ask of you will make you want
To say, "So long"
Well, I don't remember, why remember?
Do you have the keys to the hotel?
Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire! Fire!
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Life is but a
Dream for the dead
And well I, I won't go down by myself
But I'll go down with my friends
Now, now (I can't explain), now, now
Now, now, (I can't complain) now, now, yeah!
