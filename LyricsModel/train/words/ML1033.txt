summertime 
and the livin be easy 
Fish be jumpin 
and the cotton be high 
oh you daddy 's rich 
and you ma be good lookin 
so hush little baby 
do not you cry 
one of these mornin 's 
you be goin to rise up singin 
then you will spread you wing 
and you will take the sky 
but till that mornin 
there be a nothin can harm you 
with daddy and mammy 
standin by 
one of these mornin 's 
you be goin to rise up singin 
then you will spread you wing 
and you will take the sky 
but till that mornin 
there be a nothin can harm you 
with daddy and mammy 
standin by
