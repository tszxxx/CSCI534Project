try and breathe some life into a letter 
lose hope we will never be together 
my courage be at its peak 
you know what I mean 
how do you say you be okay to a answer machine 
how do you say good night to a answer machine 
big town 's get it 's loser 
small town 's get its vice 
a handful of friend 
one need a match one need some ice 
call waiting phone 
in another time zone 
how do you say I miss you to a answer machine 
how do say good night to a answer machine 

if you would like to make a call please hang up and try again 
if you need help hang up and then dial the number 

I get enough of that 
try and free a slave of ignorance 
try and teach a whore about romance 
how do you say I miss you to a answer machine 
how do you say good night to a answer machine 
how do you say I be lonely to a answer machine 
the message be very plain 
oh I hate you answer machine 
I hate you answer machine 
I hate you answer machine 
if you would like to make a call please hang up and try again 
if you need help if you need help if you need help
