Sharing you I know I be share you I be not the only one who 's in you heart when I be with you you love belong to I but you have someone else when we be apart there be two of we who kiss you two of we who miss you two of we who wish there be two of you and though it hurt I so to go on share you I know my helpless heart just can not be free but even though I must keep share you you know you will never be share I
