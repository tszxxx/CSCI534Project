mother freedom father of time 
since she leave I by myself 
you be the only family I have get leave 
I go down to that same old café 
where I try to wash my trouble away 
I be still down and I be still all alone 
but it beat stay home all night long

since she leave I by myself 
you be the only family I have get leave 
I go home and I climb that old stairway 
and I tell myself tomorrow be a new day 
but I know I will just go out again 
and spend my time with my new next of kin
