when the evening sun go down 
you will find I hang around 
the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life 
many people just like I 
dreaming of old use to be 's 
and the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life 
listen to the blue that they be play 
listen to what the blue be say 
life be just another scene 
from the world of broken dream 
and the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life 
the night life be not no good life 
but it be my life
