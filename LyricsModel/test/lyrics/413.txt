[Verse]
I could tell the moment that I saw Him
He was nothing but the trouble making kind
His hair was much too long and His motley group of friends
Had nothing but rebellion on their minds
He's rejected the establishment completely
I know for sure He's never held a job
He just goes from town to town, stirring up the young folks
Till they're nothing but a disrespectful mob
I know for sure He's never joined the army
And served His country like we all have done
He'd rather wear His sandals and His flowers
While others wage the war that must be won
They arrested Him last week and found Him guilty
And sentenced Him to die but that's no great loss
Friday they will take Him to a place called Calvary
And hang that troublemaker to a cross
