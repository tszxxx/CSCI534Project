I declare war on the world
War in outer space
I declare war in a nutshell
War all over the place
I declare war on every government
War against all odds
I declare war on your inner sanctum
On your bloodthirsty gods
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three
I delcare war on the axis of morons
All out war on complacent consent
I declare war on the war against drugs
Rape and slaughter of the innocent
War on Big Brother
Warmongers and profiteers
War on your Dogma Dubya
Armageddon's engineers
[George W Bush quote]
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three
War in a heartbeat
I declare war on so-called civilization
World trade globalization
Organized disinformation
War on ambassadors of pretense
War on MTV and CNN
McDonald's, Walt Disney and Bethlehem
On Christina, Britney and Eminem
[George W Bush quote]
I declare war on the world of anti-choice
On violent unilaterality
On the amassment of murderous high-tech toys
And all crimes against humanity
War on the moral majority
On corporate dotcom imperialism
On mindlessly bumbling stupidity
And police-state terrorism
World War Three
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three
[George W Bush quote]
