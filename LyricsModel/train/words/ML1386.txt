I would move to Rockferry tomorrow 
and I would build my house baby with sorrow 
I will leave my shadow to fall behind 
and I would not write to you cause I be not that kind 
the midnight train be board all reprobate 
I pick my load and I fill my truck before it be too late 
I leave the star to judge my every move 
I be not go to think of you or I will get the blue 
there be no sleep on the journey away from town 
a bag of song and a heavy heart will not make I down 
I will give it all my strength and my might 
I will make this decision win all the fight 
I will move to Rockferry tomorrow 
and I will build my house baby with sorrow 
I will leave my shadow to fall behind 
and I would not write to you cause I be not that kind 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry 
not that kind Rockferry
