baby can not you see I be call 
a guy like you should wear a warning 
it be dangerous I be fall 
there be no escape I can not wait 
I need a hit baby give I it

too high can not come down 
lose my head spinnin round and round 
do you feel I now 
with a taste of you lip I be on a ride 
you be toxic I be slippin under 
with a taste of a poison paradise 
I be addicted to you 
do not you know that you be toxic 
and I love what you do 
do not you know that you be toxic

I take a sip from my devil 's cup 
slowly it be take over I

with a taste of you lip I be on a ride

with a taste of a poison paradise 
I be addicted to you

and I love what you do 
do not you know that you be toxic 
do not you know that you be toxic 
with a taste of you lip I be on a ride

with a taste of a poison paradise 
I be addicted to you 
do not you know that you be toxic 
with a taste of you lip I be on a ride
