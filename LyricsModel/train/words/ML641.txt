hello I be you martyr will you be my gangster 
can you feel my trigger hand move further down you back 
when you hide hide inside that body 
but just remember that when I touch you 
the more you shake the more you give away 
cold but I be still here blind cause I be so blind say never 
we be far from comfortable this time 
cold now we be so cold mine and you be not mine say never 
we be far from obvious this time 
wait another minute here time will kill we after all 
now you can feel it be second hand wrap around you neck 
so fall into my eye and fall into my lie but do not you forget 
the more you turn away the more I want you to stay 
cold but I be still here blind cause I be so blind say never 
we be far from comfortable this time 
cold now we be so cold mine and you be not mine say never 
we be far from obvious this time 
you be so endearing you be so beautiful 
well I do not look like they do 
and I do not love like they do 
but I do not hate like they do 
be I ever on you mind 
cold but I be still here blind cause I be so blind say never 
we be far from comfortable this time 
cold now we be so cold mine and you be not mine say never 
we be far from obvious this time 
cold you break I from the very first night 
I would love you till the day that I die 
we be far too comfortable this time 
cold I love you from the very first night 
you break I till the day that I die 
I be far too obvious this time
