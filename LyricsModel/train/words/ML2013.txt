so many will worry 
on this christmas day 
but many just go so far anyway 
when the shopping be over 
it be all say and do 
the story be the same for everyone 
cause one gift 
already give that will stand the test of time 
love and mercy 
sweet forgiveness 
a gift from god the father to all mankind 
Hallelujah 
Christmas be special 
the time that we share 
the joy and the music fill the air 
but let we remember 
the message be clear 
he send we a savior to draw we near 
with one love 
from the beginning 
that will span the rest of time 
a child be bear to a world that lie wait 
to prove we father 's love for all mankind 
Hallelujah

so let we have no fear 
as we sing hallelujah 
cause one gift

that will stand the test of time 
love and mercy 
sweet forgiveness 
a gift from god the father to all mankind 
Hallelujah
