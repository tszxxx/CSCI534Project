[Verse 1]
Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
I'll get inside your groove 'cause I'm on fire, fire, fire, fire
It hurts when you get too close but, baby, it hurts
If love is really good, you just want more
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire
[Chorus]
All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more
They don't compare, all the lovers
[Verse 2]
Feel, can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside your heart, you know I'm real
Can't you see that this is going higher, higher, higher, higher?
Breathe, I know you find it hard but, baby, breathe
You'll be next to me, it's all you need
And I'll take you there, I'll take you higher, higher, higher
[Chorus]
All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more
They don't compare, all the lovers
[Bridge]
Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
Even if throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire
[Chorus]
All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more
They don't compare, all the lovers
