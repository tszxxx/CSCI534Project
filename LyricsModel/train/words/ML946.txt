love be a burn thing and it make a fiery ring bound by wild desire I fall into a ring of fire I fall into a burn ring of fire I go down , down , down and the flame go higher and it burn , burn , burn , the ring of fire the ring of fire the taste of love be sweet when heart like ours meet I fall for you like a child oh , but the fire go wild and it burn , burn , burn , the ring of fire the ring of fire
