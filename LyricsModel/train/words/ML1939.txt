Riding on these wafe 
holding on to what you say 
everything will be okay 
it will work out one way 
but I have drift way too far 
my arm my leg have grow too tired 
and could you be inspire 
no I be just tired 
and on a swing you push I hard 
so I will come back to where you be 
and you know I be never far 
no decision nothing hard 
and I know that it would rain tonight 
I will take the bus or the next flight 
I will not give up on what feel right 
if you see these tear fill my eye 
it be just the wind that make I cry 
if you could feel this pain inside 
it be from the drink we drank last night 
it be from the drink we drank last night 
and the shadow of we past 
project on cloud of dust and gas 
wound where my eye will rest 
the silhouette of loneliness 
if you see these tear fill my eye 
it be just the wind that make I cry 
if you could feel this pain inside 
it be from the drink we drank last night 
it be from the drink we drank last night
