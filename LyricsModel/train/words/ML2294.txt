something be wrong 
wrap up in mourn for far too long 
sunken eye trace the pavement and crooked line 
paint we with cross and sleepless night 
and hope to be free 
we just want to be free 
hope to be free 
who be go to set we free 
overgrown 
all we mistake be decieve we have sew 
be it time I see the stone roll back they eye 
holding they breath until they see the light 
it ought to be free 
we just want to be free 
we just want to be free 
who be go to set we free 
with we golden hair in silent sway 
we will be home when brother find he way 
with we golden hair in silent sway 
we will be home when brother find he way 
with we golden hair in silent sway 
we will be home when brother find he way 
with we golden hair in silent sway 
we will be home when brother find he way 
with we golden hair in silent sway 
we will be home when brother find he way
