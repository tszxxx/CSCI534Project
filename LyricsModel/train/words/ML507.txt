and it be a place I long for because it be where you be 
so if tomorrow you decide that it be time

and my heart be already there 
and though I know my place now be here

I know you be come back soon Lord I can see the sign 
tellin everyone about you they be run out of time 
I know you be wait cause you want they to see 
how much of Heaven Lord be live in I 
and my heart be already there

and my heart be already there 
and though I know my place now be here
