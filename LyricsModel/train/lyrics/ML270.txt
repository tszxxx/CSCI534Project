[Verse 1]
I am not skilled to understand
What God has willed what God has planned
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior
[Verse 2]
I take Him at His word and deed
Christ died to save me this I read
And in my heart I find the need
Of Him to be my Savior
[Pre-Chorus]
That He would leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die
You called it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior
[Chorus]
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
[Verse 3]
Yes living, dying let me bring
My strength my Solace from the Spring
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior
[Pre-Chorus]
That He would leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die
You called it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior
[Chorus]
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is
My God He's always gonna be
[Outro]
My Savior lives, my Savior loves
My Savior lives, my Savior loves
My Savior lives
