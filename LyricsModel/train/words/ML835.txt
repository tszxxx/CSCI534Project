you be not the kind 
you say you be fall in love with I 
that be why I sit here and cry 
for that be something that never can be 
and here be the reason why 
for you be not the kind of a boy for a girl like I 
cause I be just a song and a dance you be a symphony 
you say that you never would doubt I 
well I be tellin you you would be much better off with out I 
cause I be just the kind of a girl who would never play fair 
and you be just the kind of a boy who would always be square 
it be so hard to let you go but it be only because I know 
that you be not the kind of a boy for a girl like I 
for you be not the kind of a boy for a girl like I
