Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' home
Once I had ev'ry reason a man could want
For goin' home and makin' love, but now I don't
So I end up in here each night sittin' and a-thinkin'
Missin' her, hurtin' so and drinkin'
Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' home
It's so hard now just knowin' there's another
That she's out with him knowin' that I love her
So I end up in here each night sittin' and a-thinkin'
Missin' her, hatin' him and drinkin'
Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' home
