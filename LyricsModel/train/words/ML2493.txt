if all we life be but a dream fantastic pose greed 
then we should feed we jewelry to the sea 
for diamond do appear to be 
just like broken glass to I 
and then she say she can not believe 
genius only come along in storm of fabled foreign tongue 
tripping eye and flood lung 
northern downpour send it be love 
hey moon please forget to fall down 
hey moon do not you go down 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
the ink be run toward the page it be chase off the day 
look back at boat foot and that wind knee 
I miss you skin when you be east 
you click you heel and wish for I 
through playful lip make of yarn that fragile Capricorn 
unravel word like moth upon old scarve 
I know the world be a broken bone 
but melt you headach call it home 
hey moon please forget to fall down 
hey moon do not you go down 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
sugarcane in the easy morning 
weathervane my one and lonely 
you be at the top of my lung 
draw to the one who never yaw and
