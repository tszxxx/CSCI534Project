you be such a strange girl 
I think you come from another world 
you be such a strange girl 
I really do not understand a word 
you be such a strange girl 
I would like to shake you around and around 
you be such a strange girl 
I would like to turn you all upside down 
you be such a strange girl 
the way you look like you do 
you be such a strange girl 
I want to be with you 
I think I be fall 
I think I be fall in 
I think I be fall in love with you 
with you
