there be a little girl tremble on a cold December morn 
cry for mama 's arm 
at a orphanage just outside a little China town 
where the forget be 
but half a world away I hang the stocking by the fire 
and dream about the day when I can finally call you mine 
it be Christmas time again but you be not home 
you family be here and yet you be somewhere else alone 
so tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in he arm 
and tell you from my heart 
I wish you Merry Christmas 
as I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling light 
I be warm by the fire 's glow 
outside the child tumble in the wonderland of white 
and make angel in the snow 
but half a world away you try you best to fight the tear 
and hope that Heaven 's angel come to carry you here 
it be Christmas time again but you be not home 
you family be here and yet you be somewhere else alone 
so tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in he arm 
and tell you from my heart 
I wish you Merry Christmas 
Christmas be the time we celebrate the holy child 
and we celebrate he perfect gift of love 
he come to Earth to give he life and prepare a place for we 
so we could have a home with he above 
it be Christmas time again and now you be home 
you family be here so you will never be alone 
so tonight before you go to sleep I will hold you in my arm 
and tell you from my heart 
I will tell you from my heart 
I wish you Merry Christmas 
we wish you a Merry Christmas

we wish you a Merry Christmas 
and a happy New Year
