I hear you say 
see the road 
long and lonesome road 
dozen come from many mile away 
see the light 
they go on for mile 
but you will never see the light again in he smile 
now you be go be they move on 
do not listen girl 
listen what they say 
get no soul get no rock and roll 
and he will never hold I in he arm again 
I be so cold 
and I hear you say I hear you say 
almost take my breath away 
no he will never hold I in he arm again 
he will never hold I in he arm again 
I be so cold 
and I hear you say I hear you say 
almost take my breath away 
no he will never hold I in he arm again 
you never hold I in he arm again 
I be so cold
