[Verse 1]
Baby let me be
Your loving Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be
Your teddy bear
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
Because lions are not the kind
You love enough
Just wanna to be, your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be
Your teddy bear
