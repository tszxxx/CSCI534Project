and I will give you a piece 
gimme danger little stranger 
and I will feel you disease 
there be nothing in my dream 
just some ugly memory 
kiss I like the ocean breeze 
now if you will be my lover 
I will shiver insane 
but if you can be my master 
I will do anything 
there be nothing leave to life 
but a pair glassy eye 
raze my feeling one more time 
find a little strip and find a little stranger 
yeah you be go to feel my hand 
I get a little angel want a little danger 
honey you be go to feel my hand 
swear you be go to feel my hand 
swear you be go to feel my hand 
gimme danger 
little stranger 
gimme danger 
little stranger 
gimme danger 
little stranger 
gimme danger 
little stranger 
gimme danger 
little stranger 
can you feel I 
you get to feel I

little stranger
