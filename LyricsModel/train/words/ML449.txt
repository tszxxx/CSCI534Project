and they call it puppy love 
oh I guess they will never know 
how a young heart how it really feel 
and why I love she so 
and they call it puppy love 
just because we be seventeen 
tell they all it please tell they it be not fair 
to take away my only dream 
I cry each night 
my tear for you 
my tear be all in vain 
I hope I hope and I pray 
that maybe someday 
you will be back in my arm 
once again 
someone help I help I please 
be the answer up above 
how can I oh how can I tell they 
this be not a puppy love 
someone help I help I please 
be the answer up above 
how can I oh how can I ever tell they 
this be not a puppy love
