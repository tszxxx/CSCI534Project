[Verse 1]
Take cover
Signs don't show
You drove me off the road
[Pre-Chorus]
But you let go
Because your hope is gone
And every question fades away
[Chorus]
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Will it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?
[Post-Chorus]
You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake
[Verse 2]
You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move, move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs
[Pre-Chorus]
But you let go
Because your hope is gone
And every answer fades away
[Chorus]
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Will it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?
[Post-Chorus]
You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake
[Bridge]
Wipe the mud spray from your face
Stop the engine and stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face
Stop the engine, yeah, stop pretending
That you're still breathing
[Chorus]
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Will it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?
[Post-Chorus (2x)]
You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake
