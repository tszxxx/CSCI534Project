on the first of May it be move day 
spring be here so blow you job 
throw you job away 
now be the time to trust to you wanderlust 
in the city 's dust you wait must you wait 
just you wait 
in we mountain greenery 
where God paint the scenery 
just two crazy people together 
while you love you lover 
let blue sky be you coverlet 
when it rain we will laugh at the weather 
and if you be good 
I will search for wood 
so you can cook while I stand look 
bean could get no keener 
reception in a beanery 
bless we mountain greenery home 
mosquitoe here 
will not bite you dear 
well I will let they stenk I on the finger 
we could find no cleaner retreat 
from life 's machinery 
bless we mountain greenery home 
we mountain greenery home
