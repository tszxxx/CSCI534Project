you try to spit in the eye of a dead man 's face 
attack the way of a man not yet in he grave 
but you hate be over all too soon 
because nothing be over and nothing be through 
til we bury you 
for the love of brother 
I will sing this fuck song 
Aesthetics of hate 
I hope you rot in hell 
the word I read on the screen leave I fuck sick 
I feel the hatred rise you son of a bitch 
you brand we pathetic for we respect 
but he make we drive 
such deep reverence 
far beyond the rest 
for the love of brother 
I will say these fuck word 
Aesthetics of hate 
I hope you burn in hell 
long live memory 
live he freedom vicariously 
defend tenfold 
he honor we will always uphold 
for the love of brother I will 
say these fuck word 
no silence against ignorance 
Iconoclast 
I hope you burn 
burn in Hell 
may the hand of God strike they down 
may the hand of God strike they down 
may the hand of God strike they down 
may the hand of God 
Strike 
Dow and 
Strike Dow and 
oh may the hand of God strike they down 
may the hand of God strike they down 
may the hand of God strike they down 
may the hand of God Strike 
down
