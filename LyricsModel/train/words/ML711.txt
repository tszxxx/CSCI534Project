I put away the grocery 
and I take my daily bread 
I dream of you arm around I 
as I tuck the kid in bed 
I do not know what you be doin 
and I do not know where you be 
but I look up at that great big sky 
and I hope you be wishin on that same 
Bright star 
I wonder I pray 
and I sleep alone 
I cry alone 
and it be so hard livin here on my own 
so please come home soon 
I know that we be together 
even though we be far apart 
and I will wear we lucky penny round my neck 
press to my heart 
I wonder I pray 
I still imagine you touch 
it be beautiful miss something that much 
but sometimes love need a fighting chance 
so I will wait my turn until it be we turn to dance 
I wonder I pray 
I sleep alone 
I cry alone 
without you this house be not a home 
so please come home soon 
I walk alone 
I try alone 
I will wait for you do not want to die alone 
so please come home soon 
come home soon 
come home soon
