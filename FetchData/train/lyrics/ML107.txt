I saw you there standing under the mango tree
Beautiful women you look so fine to me
She had all the things that Ive been searching for
She had air blue hair, flower in her hair and longle shorts
Shes my honey baby, my honey baby
My honey baby, my honey baby
So that I want you to know
That where ever you go
I won't be far away
Cause as I kiss your lips
While you sway your hips
You just hear me say
Shes my honey baby, my honey baby
My honey baby, my honey baby
(instrumental)
Said my sweet honey baby
Yes you know I love you so
So hold on tight
And baby never let go
Because you know that when you call on me
Ill be there when i can
And you can count on me
Cause im a Hawaiian superman
My honey baby, my honey baby
My honey baby, my honey baby
(instrumental)
Girl I just told you how I feel for you
Every word I say yes you know its true
Before I go theres just one more thing
My darling
If you thought it could mend me with this wedding ring
Cause your my honey baby, my honey baby
My honey baby, my honey baby
My honey baby, my honey baby
Yes I want you to know that your mine
All of the time
Baby shine
Honey baby your mine
Yes I want you to know that your mine
All of the time
Baby shine
Honey baby your mine
