I will have a Blue Christmas without you 
I will be so blue just think about you 
decoration of red on a green Christmas tree 
will not be the same dear if you be not here with I 
and when those blue snowflake start fallin 
that be when those blue memory start callin 
you will be doin all right with you Christmas of white 
but I will have a blue blue blue blue Christmas 
Oooooaaaooooh 
Oooooaaaooooh 
you will be doin all right with you Christmas of white 
but I will have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
