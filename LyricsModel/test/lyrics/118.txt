[Verse 1]
I've got too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it isn't too late
[Chorus 1]
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past
[Verse 2]
I've got too much on my mind
I think of everything to be discovered
I hope there's something to find
[Chorus 1]
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past
[Chorus 2]
The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid
[Bridge]
I couldn't understand a word that they were saying
But still I hung around and took it all in
I wouldn't join in with the games that they were playing
It went by, it went by, in a flash
It flew by, it flew by, in a flash
[Verse 1]
I've got too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it's never too late
[Chorus 1]
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past
[Chorus 2]
The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid
The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid
