Winter night twinkling light 
and snowflake fall to the ground 
the air be fill with Christmas 
Santa 's sleigh kid at play 
it be that magic time of year 
when love be all around we 
and that magic 
seem to reach right out and touch I again 
just like the year before 
it be Christmas in my heart 
it seem that time stand still for Christmas 
it be time for laughter and cheer 
a time for give to other 
and share we love for those we hold so dear 
too soon the season 's over 
as I face the New Year 
this wish I make oh yeah 
at every start may it be Christmas 
always Christmas in my heart 
it seem that time stand still for Christmas 
it be time for laughter and cheer 
a time for give to other 
and share we love with those we hold so dear 
too soon the season 's over 
and as I face the New Year 
this wish I make on every start 
may it be Christmas 
always Christmas in my heart 
oh oh 
it be just Christmas in my heart 
have a good time
