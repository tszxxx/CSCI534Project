meet you on a springtime day 
you be mind you life 
and I be mind mine too 
Lady when you look my way 
I have a strange sensation 
and darl that be when I know 
that it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
yes it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
oh I wake up in the night 
and I reach beside I 
hope you will be there 
but instead I find someone 
who believe in I when I say 
I would always care 
oh it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
yes it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
so I live my life in a dream world 
for the rest of my day 
just you and I walk hand in hand 
in a wishful memory 
oh I guess that be all 
that it would ever be 
wish I have a time machine 
I could make myself go back 
until the day I be bear 
and I would live my life again 
and rearrange it so that 
I would be yours from now on 
oh it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
yes it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
oh it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
yes it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
oh it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
yes it be sad to belong to someone else 
when the right one come along 
yes it be sad to belong to someone else
