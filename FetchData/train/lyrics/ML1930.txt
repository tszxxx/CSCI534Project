Hey hey yeah
Ooh hoo hoo yeah
[Verse 1]
When I kiss your lips I just don't want to behave
My passion runs deeper and, girl, I'm not afraid
To bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about
[Verse 2]
When I kiss your lips, I just don't know where I stand
My passion runs deeper and things get out of hand
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about
[Chorus]
(Too much passion) girl, whenever we touch
(Too much passion) girl, there's never too much
(Too much passion) girl, it's never enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
[Verse 3]
Whenever you touch me I feel a fire inside
My feelings that I have for you I just can't hide
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about
[Chorus]
(Oh yeah)
[String Solo]
[Verse 1]
[Chorus]
(Hey hey)
(Ooh)
[Outro]
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough (Not enough not enough)
Too much passion is not enough (Not enough)
Too much passion is not enough (Get on up)
Too much passion is not enough (Get on up get on up) [Repeat]
