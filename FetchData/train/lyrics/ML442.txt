[Intro]
Faith
Trust
Love, love
Love can
Love can move mountains
[Verse 1]
There ain't a dream that don't have a chance to come true now
It just takes a little faith, baby
Anything that we want to do we can do now
There ain't nothing in our way, baby
Nothing our love couldn't rise above
We can get through the night
We can get to the light
Long as we got our love to light the way
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
With a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love, love can
Love can move mountains
[Bridge]
Oh yeah, baby
[Verse 2]
Oceans deep and mountains high
They can't stop us
Because love is on our side, baby
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky
Just believe it, believe in you and I, baby
If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything
We can through anything
'Cause through it all love will always find a way
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Just a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love, baby, love can
Love can move mountains
[Bridge]
(Trust)
You got to feel it, baby

You got to feel it, baby

You got to feel it, baby

(Love can, love can move mountains)
Oh, yeah
[Verse 3]
You believe in me
I believe in you
If we believe in each other
Nothing we can't do
If we got love that is strong enough
Then we'll find a way
[Chorus]
Just a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love
Love can move mountains

You got to feel it, baby

Love will find a way, baby
