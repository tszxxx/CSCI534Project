Spirit of the rise sun lift I up 
hold I there and never let I fall 
love I till I die my heart will not wait 
soon I will be love 
in this love song love 
love song love song 
hey hey love will not find 
find it 's own way home 
in this a love song love 
love love song 
Sun shine sun shine on I 
Sun shine sun shine on I 
in this love song love 
love song love song 
hey hey love will not find 
find it 's own way home 
in this love song love song 
love song love song 
Sun shine on I 
bring it through to my heart 
I would give you everything 
I will give you my desire 
Sun shine sun shine on I 
Sun shine sun shine on I
