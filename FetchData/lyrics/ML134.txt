[Spoken Intro]
Gimme a beat!
[Verse 1]
Sittin' in the movie show
Thinkin' nasty thoughts
Better be a gentleman
Or you'll turn me off
That's right, lemme tell it
[Chorus 1]
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys
[Verse 2]
I don't like no nasty car
I don't like a nasty food
The only nasty thing I like
Is a nasty groove
[Ad lib]
Will this one do?
Uh-huh, I know, say
[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys
[Chorus 1]
Nasty, nasty boys, give me a nasty groove
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, let me see your nasty body move
Oh you nasty boys
[Ad lib]
I could learn to like this, listen up
[Bridge]
I'm not a prude
No
I just want some respect
That's right
So close the door if you want me to respond
Ooh ooh yeah
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is control
No, my first name ain't baby
It's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty
[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me
Nasty, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
[Ad lib]
I love this part
[Breakdown]
Hey! Who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts?
(Nasty boys!)
Who's that in that nasty car?
(Nasty boys!)
Who's that eatin' that nasty food?
(Nasty boys!)
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove?
(Nasty boys!)
Ladies?
[Outro]
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
