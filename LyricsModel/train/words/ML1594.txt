do you want to be a poet and write 
do you want to be a actor up in light 
do you want to be a soldier and fight for love 
do you want to travel the world 
do you want to be a diver for pearl 
or climb a mountain and touch the cloud above 
be anyone you want to be 
bring to life you fantasy 
I want something in return 
I want you to burn 
burn for I baby 
like a candle in my night 
burn 
burn for I burn for I 
be you go to to be a gambler and deal 
be you go to to be a doctor and heal 
or go to heaven and touch God 's face 
be you go to be a dreamer who sleep 
be you go to be a sinner who weep 
or a angel under grace 
I will lay down on you bed of coal 
offer up my heart and soul 
but in return 
I want you to burn 
burn for I baby 
like a candle in my night 
burn 
burn for I burn for I 
ohh 
I want you to burn baby 
ohh 
laugh for I 
cry for I 
pray for I 
fly for I 
live for I 
die for we 
I want you to burn 
burn for I baby 
like a candle in my night 
oh burn 
burn for I burn for I 
I want you to burn 
I want you to burn for I baby 
burn for I 
I want you to burn 
I want you to burn for I baby
