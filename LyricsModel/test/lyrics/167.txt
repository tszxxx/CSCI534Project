[Verse 1]
You look like a perfect fit
For a girl in need of a tourniquet
[Chorus]
But can you save me
Come on and save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
[Verse 2]
'Cause I can tell
You know what it's like
The long farewell
Of the hunger strike
[Chorus]
But can you save me
Come on and save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
[Bridge]
You struck me dumb
Like radium
Like Peter Pan
Or Superman
You will come to save me
[Chorus]
C'mon and save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
'Cept the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
But the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
C'mon and save me
Why don't you save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Except the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Except the freaks who could never love anyone
