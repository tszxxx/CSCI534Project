[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I lied just a little when I said "I need you."
You stretched the truth when you said that you knew
Just can't believe it, there's nothing to say
I was almost honest, almost...
[Chorus 1]
Living alone, can't stand this place
It's four in the morning and I still see your face
[Verse 2]
I was nearly pure when I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere, you said "I'd bleed for you."
We were kind of candid, now you've gone away
You were almost honest, almost...
[Chorus 2]
Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone, but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks
[Bridge]
I question your call by the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up, but I don't have a choice
It happened that night when you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 2]
Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone, but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks
[Outro]
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest...
