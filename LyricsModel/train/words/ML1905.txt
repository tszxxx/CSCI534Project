murder book and the face in my nightmare 
Blood and tear and the enemy 's right here 
sicken broken blood shed murder you child 
torture treason never fall out 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken 
sleep my angel life have slowly slip away 
kill field and I be start to miss you 
Pornograph be all I get for a bedroom 
sicken broken blood shed murder you child 
torture treason never fall out 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken 
sleep my angel life have slowly slip away 
life be so fragile revolution take place 
bullet shell and famine and stab wound 
I wish I could do more than write you 
I be so sicken broken blood shed murder you child 
torture treason never fall out 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken glass 
stand on broken 
sleep my angel life have slowly slip away 
life be so fragile revolution take place 
sleep my angel life have slowly slip away 
broken glass
