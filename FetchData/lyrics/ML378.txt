[Verse 1]
Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
[Chorus]
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
[Verse 2]
I thought I was a fool for no one
But ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
[Chorus]
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
[Bridge]
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
Into the supermassive
[Chorus]
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
[Outro]
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
