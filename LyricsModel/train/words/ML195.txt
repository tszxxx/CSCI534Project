if the night turn cold and the star look down 
and you hug yourself on the cold cold ground 
you wake the morning in a stranger 's coat 
no one would you see 
you ask yourself who be watch for I 
my only friend who could it be 
it be hard to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I 
when you belly be empty and the hunger be so real 
and you be too proud to beg and too dumb to steal 
you search the city for you only friend 
no one would you see 
you ask yourself who be watch for I 
a solitary voice to speak out and set I free 
I have to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I 
you be not the easiest person I ever get to know 
and it be hard for we both to let we feeling show 
some would say I should let you go you way 
you will only make I cry 
if there be one guy just one guy 
who would lay down he life for you and die 
I hate to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I 
when the world be go crazy and it make no sense 
there be only one voice that come to you defense 
and the jury 's out and you eye search the room 
and one friendly face be all you need to see 
if there be one guy just one guy 
who would lay down he life for you and die 
I hate to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I 
I hate to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I 
I hate to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I 
I hate to say it 
I hate to say it but it be probably I
