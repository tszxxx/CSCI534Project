[Verse 1]
Walkin' down the street, smoggy-eyed
Looking at the sky, starry-eyed
Searchin' for the place, weary-eyed
Crying in the night, teary-eyed
[Hook] x2
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
[Verse 2]
Wonder when I'll find paradise
Somewhere there's a home sweet and nice
Wonder if I'll find happiness
Never give it up now I guess
[Hook] x2
[Verse 3]
There's no need to search anywhere
Happiness is here, have your share
If you know you're loved, be secure
Paradise is love to be sure
[Hook] x4
