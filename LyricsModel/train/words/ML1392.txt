can you believe this world be get the nerve to insist they will not trade for a better one 
can you believe this world be yell out in the dark it want to be leave alone 
can you believe this world never would have have the chance without we give it blood 
can you believe this world lack the common courtesy to thank we all for the love 
set it on fire 
set it on fire 
set it on fire 
set it on fire 
set it on fire 
can you believe this world be like a glassy eyed swiller catch sip another one 
can you believe this world be like a tyrant take over anything that it want 
can you believe this world be like a wounded martyr worried if he commitment be go 
can you believe this world be like a vagrant in the gutter talk nothing be wrong 
can you believe this world be just a double deal joker go to stick to he gun 
can you believe this world be just a television blaring a million devil at once 
can you believe this world be just a charmer in disguise with a lavender soul 
can you believe this world 's just exactly as we build it run out of control
