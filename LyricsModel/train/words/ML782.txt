dream of a land my soul be from 
I hear a hand stroke on a drum 
elegant boy 
beautiful girl 
dancing for joy 
elegant whirl 
shade of delight 
cocoa hue 
Rich as the night 
afro blue 
two young lover dance face to face 
with undulate grace 
they gently sway 
then slip away 
to some secluded place 
shade of delight 
cocoa hue 
Rich as the night 
afro blue 
whisper tree 
echo they sigh 
passionate plea 
tender reply 
lover in flight 
upward they glide 
burst at the height 
slowly subside 
shade of delight 
cocoa hue 
Rich as the night 
afro blue 
and my slumbering fantasy assume reality 
until it seem it be not a dream 
the two be you and I 
shade of delight 
cocoa hue 
Rich as the night 
afro blue 
oh shade of delight 
cocoa hue 
Rich as the night 
afro blue
