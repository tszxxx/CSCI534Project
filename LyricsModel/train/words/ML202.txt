I see tree of green red rose too 
I see they bloom for I and for you 
and I think to myself what a wonderful world 
I see sky of blue and cloud of white 
the bright bless day dark sacred night 
and I think to myself what a wonderful world 
the color of the rainbow so pretty in the sky 
be also on the face of people go by 
I see friend shake hand sayin' how do you do 
they be really sayin' I love you 
I hear baby cry I watch they grow 
they will learn much more than I will never know 
and I think to myself what a wonderful world 
yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
