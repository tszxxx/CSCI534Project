it be the same old song 
you get to be somewhere at sometime 
and they never let you fly 
it be like broken glass 
you get cut before you see it 
so open up you eye 
you get desire 
so let it out 
you get the power 
stand up and shout 
shout stand up and shout 
you get wing of steel 
but they never really move you 
you only seem to crawl 
you have be nail to the wheel 
but never really turn 
you know you get to work it out 
you get desire 
so let it out 
you get the power 
stand up and shout 
shout stand up and shout 
let it out 
you be the strongest chain 
and you be not just some reflection 
so never hide again 
you be the driver 
you own the road 
you be the fire 
go on explode 
you get desire 
so let it out 
you get the power 
stand up and shout 
stand up and shout 
let it out 
stand up and shout
