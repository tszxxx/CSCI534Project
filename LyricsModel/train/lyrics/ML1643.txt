Happy Christmas (War is Over)
John Lennin
So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun
Ans so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young
{Refrain}
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas		(War is over)
For weak and for strong		(If you want it)
For rich and the poor ones		(War is over)
The world is so wrong		(Now)
And so happy Christmas		(War is over)
For black and for white		(If you want it)
For yellow and red ones		(War is over)
Let's stop all the fight		(Now)
{Refrain}
And so this is Christmas		(War is over)
And what have we done		(If you want it)
Another year over			(War is over)
And a new one just begun		(Now)
Ans so happy Christmas		(War is over)
I hope you have fun		(If you want it)
The near and the dear one		(War is over)
The old and the young		(Now)
{Refrain}
War is over
If you want it
War is over
