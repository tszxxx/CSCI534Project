[Verse: INNA]
Dangerous feelings break out my soul
It's just the meaning of being alone
I need you here, wherever you are
I need you now to take me so far
I wanna run like the speed of the sound
I was somewhere, I feel you around
You give me now the meaning of life
With you, I'm feeling alive
[Chorus: INNA]
Why you're lookin' like that?
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing
[Interlude: Play &amp; Win]
Go!
[Chorus: INNA]
Why you're lookin' like that?
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing
Why you're lookin' like that?
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing
Why you're lookin' like that?
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing
