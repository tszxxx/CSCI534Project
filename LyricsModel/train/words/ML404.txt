there be a man in a Stetson hat howlin like a alley cat 
outside my window tonight 
sayin baby put on something hot meet I in the parking lot 
about a quarter to nine 
I get the feelin that he be never read Romeo and Juliet 
I be gettin tired of these one night stand 
but if you want to make a real romance 
I be that kind of girl I be that kind of girl 
I be not the woman in red I be not the girl next door 
but if somewhere in the middle 's what you be lookin for 
I be that kind of girl I be that kind of girl 
let I tell you that I like my lovin just as much as any woman 
but I be drawin the line 
a little sensitivity always seem to get to I every time 
I be a sucker for a love sick fool 
the kind that carry all you book in school 
I be get tired of these one night stand 
but if you be lookin for a real romance 
I be that kind of girl I be that kind of girl 
I be not the woman in red I be not the girl next door 
but if somewhere in the middle 's what you be lookin for 
I be that kind of girl I be that kind of girl 
I be that kind of girl I be that kind of girl 
I be not the woman in red I be not the girl next door 
but if somewhere in the middle 's what you be lookin for 
I be that kind of girl I be that kind of girl 
I be that kind of girl oh whoa 
I be that kind of girl oh whoa
