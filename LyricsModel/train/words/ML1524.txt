black magic rite on this black evil night 
begin with the slice of the blade 
Metal and blood come together as one 
onlooker they gasp in dismay 
taste the sweet blood of one another 
share without any greed 
bang you head as if up from the dead 
intense metal be all that you need 
murder in the front row 
crowd begin to bang 
and there be blood upon the stage 
bang you head against the stage 
and metal take it 's price 
bond by blood 
Metal take hold death start to unfold 
it be loud like the world at a end 
you be in a blood fury the metal will not stop 
onlooker they bang at command 
cut you palm and drink you blood 
the power that few other dare 
you feel the need to go out and kill 
the same need that you blood brother share 
murder in the front row crowd begin to bang 
and there be blood upon the stage 
bang you head against the stage 
and metal take it 's price 
bond by blood
