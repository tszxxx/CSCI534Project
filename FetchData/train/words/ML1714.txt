we be break up , get lose in the static you be get blurry right in front of I the footstep grow quiet in the hallway as I let go , let go the gravity that attract we help we implode or else we would keep divide but I know , I know we be aim straight at each other we be doom to crash so strike up a fire , light up the town ' cause we be aim straight at each other this be mean to last so do not try to fight it , the chaos will calm we down we lip move but we speak in a language that neither one of we can understand you sleepwalk through the tape and the siren I let go , let go the rule of we attraction be carve in stone and yet you keep resist but I know , I know it do not matter , it 's a disaster it do not matter the chaos will calm we down
