[Verse 1: Jamie Hince, 
Alison Mosshart
]
Walk you to the counter
What you got to offer
Pick you out a soda
Look at you forever
Walk you to the water
Eyes like a casino
You ain't born 
typical
Find a piece of silver
Pretty as a diagram
Go down to the Rio
Put it in my left hand
Put it in a fruit machine
Everyone's a winner
Laughing like a seagull
[Chorus: 
both
]
You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical
You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical
[Verse 2:Jamie Hince,

Living in a suitcase
Meet a clown and fall in love
Been dying to have you over
Clown around and break up
Take you to a jukebox
That's the situation
Pick you out a number
That's our arrangement
Dancing on the legs of a new born pony
Left right left right, keep it up son
Go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her when you were a fever
[Chorus: both]
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
