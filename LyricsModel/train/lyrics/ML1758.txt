You shatter me
Your grip on me - a hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me
Infectious sense of hopelessness and prayers for rain
I suffocate
I breathe in dirt and nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me
Your hands on me - a touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
I deteriorate
I live in dirt and nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me
Your hands on me - a touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
