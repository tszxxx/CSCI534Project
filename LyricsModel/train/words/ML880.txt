wish I know 
why I be so in love with you 
no one else in this world will do 
darl please save you love for I 
run away 
if I be wise I would run away 
but like a fool I stay 
and pray you will aave you love for I 
I can feel it 
even when you be not here 
can not conceal it 
I really love you my dear 
and though I know no good 
can come from love you 
I can not do a thing I be so in love with you 
so darl 
help I please 
have mercy on a fool like I 
I be so unwise but still I plead 
darl please save you love for I 
I can feel it 
even when you be not here 
can not conceal it 
I really love you my dear 
and though I know no good 
can come from love you 
I can not do a thing I be so in love with you 
so darl help I please 
have mercy on a fool like I 
I know I be lose but stll I plead 
darl please save you love for I 
you can have fun with the crowd 
but for cry out loud 
darl please save you love for I
