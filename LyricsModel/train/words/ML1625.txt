I be you sinking stone 
I would rather be alone than drag you down and pick you up 
have not you be through enough 
I be the cruel one 
do not know how I have become 
a movie where the act show somebody you use to know 
you use to know 
oh no 
I do not want to wake up feeling like I be no one 
I do not want to wake up wonder how do I become the cruel one 
it be quicker than you think 
sadness spread out like ink on the road and on the sea 
on the roof and balcony 
I be use loneliness and now it be use I 
there be nothing leave to give to you 
one thing leave to say to you 
oh no 
I do not want to wake up feeling like I be no one 
I do not want to wake up wonder how do I become the cruel one 
I do not want to waste my time 
stand in a waiting line 
when I know what I want and you be just what I want 
I do not want to waste my day worry what they will say 
now I know what I want you be just what I want 
oh no 
I do not want to wake up feeling like I be no one 
I do not want to wake up wonder how do I become the cruel one
