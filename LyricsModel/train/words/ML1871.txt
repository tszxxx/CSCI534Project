Sympathy be overrated 
like a snapshot when you have lose the game

I have become a serial killer of we both 
now it be all a funeral 
I have become a serial killer of we both

do not try you know that we already know it 
it be over 
at you own burial 
do not forget to cry at you own burial 
think of my 81st birthday

remember how I would raise a army 
when we go back to you place 
now it be all a funeral 
I have become a serial killer of we both 
now it be all a funeral 
I have become a serial killer of we both

at you own burial 
do not forget to cry at you own burial 
at you own burial

at you own burial 
do not forget to cry 
at you own burial
