love be a razor and I walk the line on that silver blade Slept in the dust with he daughter she eye red with the slaughter of innocence and I will pray for she , I will call she name out loud I would bleed for she , if I could only see she now live on a razor 's edge balanc on a ledge live on a razor 's edge on balanc on a ledge balanc on a ledge live on a razor 's edge balanc on a ledge , you know , you know the evil that man do life on and on Circle of fire , my baptism of joy at a end it seem the seventh lamb slain , the book of life open before I and I will pray for you , some day I may return do not you cry for I , beyond be where I learn live on a razor 's edge balanc on a ledge live on a razor 's edge you know , you know the evil , the evil the evil that man do the evil , the evil the evil that man do
