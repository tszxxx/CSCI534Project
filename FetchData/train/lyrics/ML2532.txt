He'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her
Again, again and again
He musta brought the jukebox cause those old sad songs they just won't
End, they just won't end
His old broken heart, it still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire
Chorus:
And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
And then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery
And his old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire
His tears fall like rain but his pain just won't die down
Cause theres another blaze thats brewin
As he buys another round
Repeat chorus
He'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her
Again
