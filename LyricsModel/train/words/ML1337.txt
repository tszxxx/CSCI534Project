train be speed over the track 
I can not see through the fog 
I can not see where you be at 
take every sin from you heart 
and put it to good use 
let it out from the start 
oh I get you 
oh I need you 
it be easy to believe what you do 
oh I get you 
oh I need you 
it be easy to believe in the truth 
we will tear the air from you lung 
the picture be not clear 
do not show anyone 
black turn to gray in the sun 
it always fade away 
the color bleed and they run 
oh I get you 
oh I need you 
it be easy to believe what you do 
oh I get you 
oh I need you 
it be easy to believe in the truth
