I have feel the thunder speak of you name and I have watch the lightning , you glory proclaim I have gazed upon mountain that testify of you fame and I have hear the wave on the ocean echo they refrain this be my song , my song to the King and I stand in awe of you majesty and I do not have much , but I give everything this be my song , song to my King it seem all creation , oh it 's longing for you from here to the farthest star they be worshipping you and who be I God that you be mindful of I I be simple in heart , simple in song , I be a small offer but this be my song , my song to the King and I stand in awe of you majesty and I do not have much but I give everything for this be my song , my song to the King it 's all the creation hesitate now and all of the angel stop sing now as the King of all glory listen to my song this be my song , my song to my King and I stand in awe of you majesty and I do not have much but I give everything for this be my song , song to my King be my song to my King my song to my King
