here within my heart 
the very deepest part 
I keep to myself 
but you love make I strong 
and now my heart belong 
to no one else 
there be no one else 
only you 
can have the part of I 
I give to only you 
no one else can love I 
just the way you do 
no matter what we go through 
forever I love only you 
there be something in you touch 
that tell I just how much 
you feel inside 
you be not afraid to show 
how far you love would go 
there be no end in sight 
so for all my life 
forever forever 
only you 
can have the part of I 
I give to only you 
no one else can love I 
just the way you do 
no matter what we go through 
forever I love only you 
forever I love only you 
forever I love only you
