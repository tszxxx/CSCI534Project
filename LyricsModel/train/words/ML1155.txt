I get so lonely can not let just anybody hold I

sittin here with my tear 
all alone with my fear I be wonder 
if I have to do withoutcha 
but there be no reason why 
I feel asleep late last night 
cryin like a newborn child

so that I have 
the chance to beg you to stay 
I want no one but you 
I get so lonely can not let just anybody hold I
