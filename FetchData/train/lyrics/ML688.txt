[Verse 1]
I did not take to analysis
So I had to make up my mind
And hold it for awhile
I would not just leave you without a kiss -
But I guess there must come a time
When there's no more tears to cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Bees and snakes need homes
 (need homes)
Barricade
[Chorus 1]
It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
And it kinda does
Starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
[Verse 2]
I could not lean on the politics
Cause I didn't want to train my eye
To hold so short a time
Also, 
I just don't know where the blind could lead the sightless
But 
I still like to witness
[Pre-Chorus]
Bees and snakes need homes (need homes)
Barricade
[Chorus 1]
It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
And it kinda does
Starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
(keep us all away)
[Chorus 2]
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
Return to, past times
Full speed, half blind
(You know us, you know us)
(What we saw was a matter of fiction)
(And I'm sorry)
(And a plan)
(Say I'm sorry)
[Chorus 1]
Sometimes it feels like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
And it kinda does
And how much fear can you fabricate to keep us away? (keep us away)
When you know us
[Chorus 2]
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed half blind
[Chorus 2]
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
On to old times
Full speed half blind
