I be sittin in the railway station 
get a ticket for my destination mmm 
on a tour of one night stand 
my suitcase and guitar in hand 
and every stop be neatly plan 
for a poet and a one man band 
Homeward bound 
I wish I be 
Homeward bound 
Home where my thought 's escape 
Home where my music 's playing 
Home where my love lie wait 
silently for I 
everyday be a endless stream 
of cigarette and magazine mmm 
and each town look the same to I 
the movie and the factory 
and every stranger 's face I see 
remind I that I long to be 
Homeward bound 
I wish I be 
Homeward bound 
Home where my thought 's escape 
Home where my music 's playing 
Home where my love lie wait 
silently for I 
tonight I will sing my song again 
I will play the game and pretend mmm 
but all my word come back to I 
in shade of mediocrity 
like emptiness in harmony 
I need someone to comfort I 
Homeward bound 
I wish I be 
Homeward bound 
Home where my thought 's escape 
Home where my music 's playing 
Home where my love lie wait 
silently for I 
silently for I
