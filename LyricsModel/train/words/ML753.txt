she be call a scarlet woman by the people 
who would go to church but leave I in the street 
with no parent of my own I never have a home 
but a eighteen year old boy have get to eat 
she find I outside one Sunday morning 
beg money from a man I do not know 
she take I in and wipe away my childhood 
a woman of the street this lady rose 
this bed of rose 's that I lay on 
where I be teach to be a man 
this bed of rose 's where I be live 
be the only kind of life I will understand 
she be a handsome woman just thirty five 
who be speak to in town by very few 
she manage a late evening business 
like most of the town wish they could do 
and I learn all the thing that a man should know 
from a woman not approve of I suppose 
she die know someone really love she 
of life 's bramble bush I pick a rose
