those tire track 
zigzag you torso like a Devil 's self portrait 
the car accident the skin graft treatment 
the flower basket the wincing relative 
you bid she farewell then get in you car 
and that be the last thing that you can recall 
and when they pull you out 
you do not know you name 
explode semi truck blurred you face with flame 
you meet Jane four year ago today 
dance at some vomit stain frat party 
she newspaper gown glow headline brown 
she violent gypsy dance she tired underpant 
love love love love 
love love love love 
love love love love 
rhyme with pity now 
love love love love 
love love love love 
love love love love 
rhyme with sympathy now 
Jane let you touch and feel she 
she be so free like a pineapple in a tree 
you say it be dangerous 
to be so intimate 
you know it be dangerous dangerous dangerous 
Jane say when she lay on she back 
the sun hit she body like a ugly landscape 
but some thing never get better 
like use car and bad lifer 
so you trade she in for a better look brand 
one with fake porno tit 
a padlock on she lip 
Disposable tan biodegradable hand 
back at the hospital 
you get no visitor at all 
she visit you in you sleep 
but that newspaper gown be always on fire 
she meet he a week after you leave she 
when you toss out she touch to the garbage collector 
he talk she out of she skirt in he beer soak apartment 
and then they do all the thing 
you never say that you want 
and the siren be laugh underneath you skull 
and you thought be turn dull callous and cold 
yesterday you give you burden a name 
yesterday you give you burden a face 
but you burden look a awful lot like she 
love love love love 
love love love love 
love love love love 
rhyme with pity now 
love love love love 
love love love love 
love love love love 
rhyme with sympathy now
