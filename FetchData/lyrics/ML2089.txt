When I make it I'll be on time
Gonna take what I want and give you a piece of my mind
Your black heart's waited too long
Just to see me fall down, fall down, fall down
Your black heart's won't be around just to see me fall down
Your heart's on fire, so come on burn brighter
Your heart's on fire, so come on burn brighter
Your heart's on fire but you're cold to the touch
I know you want it but you love yourself too much
Your heart's on fire but your head is a rut
You best believe it, I ain't ever giving up, yeah
When I make it I'll be on time
Well, you might say I'm crazy
But oh, oh, I'm out of my mind
Well, excuse me, black hearts
Will you tell me who's up and who is down?
Are you waiting for me to fall down?
Your heart's on fire, so come on burn brighter
Your heart's on fire, so come on burn brighter
Your heart's on fire but you're cold to the touch
I know you want it but you love yourself too much
Your heart's on fire but your head is a rut
You best believe it, I ain't ever giving up
So come on, come on, come on, hey yeah
Your heart's on fire but you're cold to the touch
I know you want it but you love yourself too much
Your heart's on fire but your head is a rut
You best believe it, I ain't ever giving up
