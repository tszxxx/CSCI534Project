I be there when you 
shone as bright as 
Bethlehem from afar 
I be there when 
you be young and strong and perverted 
and everything that make a young man a star 
oh you be a star 
I be there and i swear to god 
and on my mother 's grave 
on everything i have 
or ever will embrace 
I be there 
and i see it with my own two eye 
and now it be all around I 
it be all around I 
I be surround 
now it be all around I 
it be all around I 
you surround I like a circle 
I be there 
c'mon and tell I i be not worth 
stick it out for 
well i be there 
and i know i be worth it 
cause if i be not worth it 
that make I worse off then you be 
and now it be all around I 
it be all around I 
I be surround 
now it be all around I 
it be all around I 
you surround I like a circle 
but do not you lose sight of I now 
do not lose you sight of I now 
cause i be there 
when they drop the bomb 
ya know i remember the bomb 
and i still hear the bomb 
and i still fight the bomb 
you know i still fear the bomb 
you know i still hate the bomb 
sometimes i still get the call 
so do not you lose sight of I now 
do not you lose sight of I now 
you know you be all around I all around I 
I be surround 
you know you be all around I all around I 
I be surround 
you know you be all around I all around I 
I be surround 
you be all around I all around I all around I 
I be surround 
you surround I like a circle
