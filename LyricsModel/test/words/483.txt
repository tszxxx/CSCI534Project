old man lie by the side of the road with the lorry roll by Blue moon sink from the weight of the load and the building scrape the sky Cold wind rip down the alley at daw n and the morning paper fly dead man lie by the side of the road with the daylight in he eye do not let it bring you down it 's only castle burn find someone who 's turn and you will come around Blind man run through the light of the night with a answer in he hand come on down to the river of sight and you can really understand Red light flash through the window in the rain can you hear the siren moan ? White cane lie in a gutter in the lane if you be walk home alone do not let it bring you down it 's only castle burn find someone who 's turn and you will come around do not let it bring you down it 's only castle burn just find someone who 's turn and you will come around
