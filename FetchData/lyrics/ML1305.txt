[Verse 1]
Hey you
The longtime stranger
Do you think of before?
When we were wrapped up in ourselves
In a mess behind the door
Now it seems so, so immature
Your stolen signs
The stickers on your door
[Chorus]
The beginning was warmer
Than your ending prose
You were another conqueror
I was another part disposed
I guess that's just the way it goes
[Verse 2]
Hey you
My one time wonderer
Do you feel for before?
It is etched out in photographs
And scratched up records
Now it seems so, so immature
Your postered walls
The dirt on your floor
[Chorus]
The beginning was warmer
Than your ending prose
You were another conqueror
I was another part disposed
[Bridge]
So I want to know
Did you ever think of me on a summer's day?
Or holding her hand out in the rain?
Remember I said 'Please, please, please don't go'
And now we're just strangers in different worlds
[Outro]
I guess that's just the way it goes
Well I guess that's just the way it goes
