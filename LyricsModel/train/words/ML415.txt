I would gladly walk across the desert 
with no shoe upon my foot 
to share with you the last bite 
of bread I have to eat 
I would swim out to save you 
in you sea of broken dream 
when all you hope be sinkin 
let I show you what love mean 
love can build a bridge 
between you heart and mine 
love can build a bridge 
do not you think it be time 
do not you think it be time 
I would whisper love so loudly 
every heart could understand 
that love and only love 
can join the tribe of man 
I would give my heart 's desire 
so that you might see 
the first step be to realize 
that it all begin with you and I 
when we stand together 
it be we finest hour 
we can do anything anything 
keep believin in the power 
love and only love 
love and only love
