out on the highway a lot of pretty girl go by 
but none have be right 
up until today I would never settle down 
but you keep come around 
and you love be a miracle it be spiritual 
get here just in time 
you love be a miracle it be visible 
even to a heart that be blind like mine 
out in the wildlife a lot of people tell lie 
lookin right in you eye 
and up until tonight I be always on the prowl 
but now I be settlin down 
cause you love be a miracle it be spiritual 
stand the test of time 
you love be a miracle it be visible 
even to a heart that be blind like mine 
anyone can see what you be do to I 
and everyone can see that you be everything I need 
cause you love be a miracle it be spiritual 
get here just in time 
you love be a miracle it be visible 
even to a heart that be blind like mine
