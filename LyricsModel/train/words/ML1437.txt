some kind of nature 
some kind of soul 
some kind of mixture 
some kind of gold 
some kind of majesty 
some chemical load 
some kind of metal 
make up from glue 
some kind of plastic 
I could wrap around you 
the needy eat man-made 
they wear phony clothes 
they sit with barbiturate 
until they grow old 
some kind of nature 
some kind of soul 
some kind of mixture 
some kind of gold 
some kind of majesty 
some chemical load 
well I I like plastic 
and digital foil 
to wrap up the sound 
and protect the girl 
from the spiritual poison 
you spill at night 
like phony clothes but 
I really like mine 
some kind of nature 
some kind of soul 
some kind of mixture 
some kind of gold 
verse 3 Lou Reed and 
both 

some kind of metal 
make up from glue 
some kind of plastic 
I could wrap around you 
the needy eat man-made 
they wear phony clothes 
they sit with barbiturate 
until they grow old 
some kind of nature 
some kind of soul 
some kind of mixture 
some kind of gold
