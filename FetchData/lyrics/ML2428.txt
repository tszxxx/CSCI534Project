Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath
To those nice, nice nights
I remember always, always
I got such a fright
Seeing them in my dark cupboard
With my great big cake
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you, and I was you
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you, and I was you
If they were me and I was you
Would you've liked a present too?
Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath
To those nice, nice nights
I remember always, always
I got such a fright
Seeing them in my dark cupboard
With my great big cake
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you and I was you -
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you and I was you -
If they were me and I was you
Would you've liked a present too?
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
