melody it be she second name x 4 
come home one morning about quarter to three 
I be bang on my door because I just lose my key 
open up baby you get someone else inside 
I be go to come get you dead or alive 
I take she out dance but she drank away my cash 
she say I be go to fix my face do not you worry I will be back 
I be look for she high and low like a mustard for a ham 
she be crash out in the bathroom 
in the arm of my best friend 
then one day she leave I 
she take everything that move 
my car she take my trailer home 
she take my Sunday boot 
my nose be on she trail 
I be go to catch she by surprise 
then I be go to have the pleasure 
to roast that child alive
