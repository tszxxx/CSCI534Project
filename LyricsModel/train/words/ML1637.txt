you want to fly on the wing of a eagle 
everybody have to dream 
well you fight like a fighter you look like no other 
take what you want you think you will ride with the demon 
as deadly as the seven sin 
you think that you be magic 
but I be no believer 
and you fight like a little contender 
a broken heart you can never surrender 
a thousand kiss return to sender 
you word they come to no good intention 
you preach every word you say 
you stick and you stone break more than my bone 
you say you love I then you hate I then you be hot then cold 
head to toe in diamond you be not undersold 
you think that you be magic 
but I be no believer 
and you fight like a little contender 
a broken heart you can never surrender 
a thousand kiss return to sender 
I want to help and i want to protect ya 
but you get you spy tell lie 
where do you go you change colour like a tiger in the snow 
and you fight like a little contender 
a broken heart you can never surrender 
a thousand kiss return to sender 
I want to love girl but somehow I can not let you in 
disguise in all you makeup like the seven sin 
you have get you magic 
but I be no believer 
and you fight like a little contender 
a broken heart you can never surrender 
a thousand kiss return to sender 
I want to help and i want to protect ya 
but you get you spy tell lie 
where do you go you change colour like a tiger in the snow
