I guess we have have we fun 
but it seem we fun be over now 
and that be all right 
it be all right 
time for I to move along 
and after all be say and do 
I will be all right 
and it be all right 
tell I something that be sure to break my heart 
cause everything be my fault 
and I know 
I deserve to be alone 
cause everything be my fault 
here we go again unsuccessful to make amend 
and that be all right 
and it be all right 
I have try as hard as I can but I can not seem to understand 
and that be all right 
and it be all right 
tell I something that be sure to break my heart 
cause everything be my fault 
and I know 
I deserve to be alone 
cause everything be my fault 
I guess it be over now you honesty have all run out 
but that be all right 
and it be all right 
I just can not seem to see how the hell you can make believe 
that it be all right 
it be all right 
tell I something that be sure to break my heart 
cause everything be my fault 
and I know 
I deserve to be alone 
cause everything be my fault 
cause everything be my fault 
cause everything be my fault 
cause everything be my fault 
everything be my fault
