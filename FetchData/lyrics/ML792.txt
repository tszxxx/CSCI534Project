[Verse 1]
Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you
[Chorus]
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do?
[Verse 2]
Every time you go away
I'll always say it's goodbye, dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you I'd die, dear
[Chorus]
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do?
[Break]
[Chorus]
Knowing I love you so, hey
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
[Outro]
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too, yeah
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you?
Anywone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And always love me, love me
Then why won't you?
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would, woo, take me
Why, why won't you?
No one's gonna love you like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one...
