you bruise so easily love 
we heart 's racing again 
once the bloom leave the rose 
all that be leave be regret and sorrow 
do not be a stranger 
misanthrope 
do not take my hand 
if you know you will never love again 
it be the death of romance 
the death of romance 
the death of romance 
it be the death of romance 
the rope be too tight around my hand 
I do not want to understand 
obscure by light a stain inside 
even you tattoo cross 
be too heavy to bear 
angel sing that closing hymn to I 
can not you hear 
those angel sing the closing hymn to I 
it be the death of romance 
the death of romance 
the death of romance 
it be the death of romance 
it be the death of you and I 
it be not the end you see 
well patience get to pay 
the price tonight 
it be the death of romance 
death of romance
