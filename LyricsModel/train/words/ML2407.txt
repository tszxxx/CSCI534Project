I be tired of lick they boot that be a- kick I 
sick of they sour grape they keep a pickin´ I 
set loose you wing cut the string of you puppeteer 
freedom begin baby between you ear 
reach for the sky 
you do not have to buy what they be advertisin´ 
not when you be mile high and risin 
open my eye to the lie that would be a-trickin´ I 
cut all the horn pull the thorns that would be stickin´ I 
Chorus 
if you get the feelin´ what they be dealin´ get you live under way too low a 
ceiling 
cut through you doom and you gloom 
C´mon and grab yourself some headroom 
Chorus
