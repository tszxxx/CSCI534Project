[Verse 1]
Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?
[Chorus]
Love hurts
But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive
[Verse 2]
I'm fettered and abused
Stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one-man submarine?
I only want the truth
So tonight, we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?
[Chorus]
Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive
Without love, I won't survive
[Chorus]
Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive
[Outro]
Love hurts, oh oh, love hurts
Without love I won’t survive
Love hurts, oh, love hurts
Without love I won’t survive
