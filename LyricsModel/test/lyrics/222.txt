[Verse 1]
Keep knocking
No one's there
Pouring down
Near be felt
[Chorus]
I'm out here by myself all alone
Ready to blow my head off I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same I just wanna laugh again
[Verse 2]
Keep hoping
Nothing to spare
So my life
Isn't quite there
Feel like a whore
A dirty whore
Such a whore
Dirty
[Chorus]
I'm out here by myself all alone
Ready to blow my head off I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same I just wanna laugh again
[Bridge]
I'll take it
I'll take it
I will take it
Into you
[Verse 3]
You dirty little boy!
Dirty little boy!
You dirty little boy!
Dirty little boy!
You dirty little boy!
Dirty little boy!
You dirty little boy!
Dirty little boy!
You dirty little boy!
[Outro]
I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same I just wanna laugh again
