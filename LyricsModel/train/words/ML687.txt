I know where I be go 
I must be a mile asleep 
this destination that I feel all my life be 
Movin I on movin I on 
I know why I be go 
I see it in my sleep 
insinuation of a diamond place by vision of you 
bringin I joy 
Movin I on like a river 
Rollin I on 
Movin I on like a river 
Rollin I on 
I know now I be go 
there be no time to waste on a sleep 
across a nation of vision of you 
Movin I too closer to you 
Movin I on like a river 
Rollin I on 
I be closer to you 
Movin I on like a river 
Rollin I on 
I be closer to you 
Movin I on like a river 
Rollin I on 
I be closer to you 
Movin I on like a river 
Rollin I on 
like a river movin I on 
I be closer to you 
like a river movin I on 
I be closer to you 
like a river movin I on
