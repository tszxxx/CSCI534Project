[Verse 1]
Don't try to explain your mind, I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and suddenly it's like a battlefield
One word turns into war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down?
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now
[Pre-Chorus]
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing
Oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now?
[Chorus]
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
Why does love always feel like...
[Verse 2]
Can't swallow our pride, neither of us wanna raise that flag
If we can't surrender, then we both gonna lose what we had
Oh no
[Pre-Chorus]
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing (Nothing)
Oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
I don't wanna fall for it now
[Chorus]
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
Why does love always feel like
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
A battlefield (Battlefield)
[Post-Chorus]
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your...
[Bridge]
We could pretend that we are friends tonight (Oh)
And in the morning, we'd wake up and we'd be alright
'Cause baby, we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like...
[Chorus]
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
Guess you better go and get your armor
[Chorus]
I never meant to start a war (Start a war)
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
(What are we fighting for?)
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
[Chorus]
Why does love always feel like...
Ohh
Why does love always feel like...
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
[Outro]
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
