I want to know how the story go 
and if the sad song write about how much you know 
about what really happen obviously 
you have get a skewed view or you be not present to see 
with a healthy dose of evident 
fabrication fill we in 
I want to know where you be come from 
and where you be go 
have you come undone 
there be a vitamin in this tune 
step back a little bit 
give yourself room 
when you say when you say how it use to be 
understand I do not need the waste follow I 
when you say when you say how it use to be 
understand I do not need the waste follow I 
when you say when you say how it use to be 
understand I do not need the waste follow I 
winding 
it up 
twist it 
undone 
winding 
it up 
twist it 
undone 
when you say when you say
