home for the holiday 
I believe I have miss each and every face 
come on and play one easy 
let 's turn on the love light in the place 
it be time I find myself 
totally surround in you circle 
oh my friend 
please celebrate I home 
give I a number 
please celebrate I home 
play I one more song 
that I will always remember 
I can recall whenever I 
find myself too all alone 
I can sing I home 
uneasy highway 
travel where the westerly wind can fly 
somebody try to tell I 
but the man forget to tell I why 
I get to count on be go 
come on mama 
come on daddy 
hear what you want from I yeah 
I will be strong and 
I will be weak 
please celebrate I home 
give I a number 
please celebrate I home 
play I one more song 
that I will always remember 
I can recall whenever I 
find myself too all alone 
I can sing I home 
please celebrate I home 
give I a number 
please celebrate I home 
play I one more song 
that I will always remember 
I can recall whenever I 
find myself too all alone 
I can sing I home
