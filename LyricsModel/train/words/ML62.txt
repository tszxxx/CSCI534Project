can you see like a child 
can you see what I want 
I want to run through you wicked garden 
Heard that be the place to find you 
cause I be alive 
so alive now 
I know the darkness blind you 
can you see without eye 
can you speak without lie 
I want to drink from you naked fountain 
I can drow you sorrow 
I be go to burn burn you to life now 
out of the chain that bind you 
can you see just like a child 
can you see just what I want 
can I bring you back to life 
be you scared of life 
burn burn burn 
burn you wicked garden down 
burn burn burn 
burn you wicked garden to the ground 
can you feel pain inside 
can you love 
can you cry 
I want to run through you wicked garden 
Heard that be the place to find you 
cause I be alive 
so alive now 
out of the dark that blind you 
can you see just like a child 
can you see just what I want 
can I bring you back to life 
be you scared of life 
burn burn burn 
burn you wicked garden down 
burn burn burn 
burn you wicked garden to the ground
