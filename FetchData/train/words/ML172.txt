I be in love again be like this before I be in love again this time 's true , I be sure do not want to end up like no nine - day wonder I have be hurt so many time before so my darling , I will never leave you it 's in my blood to always love you more , love you more it 's my heart again that drive I so wild I just can not explain although , I be not a child so why would I cry if you ever leave I ? maybe ' cause you be all I be live for with every heartbeat , I want you madly it 's in my blood to always love you more , love you more oh my love , again what I say be true though it may sound plain I love you and it mean more to I than life can offer and if this be not true love , then , I be sure that after this love , there will be no other until the razor cut
