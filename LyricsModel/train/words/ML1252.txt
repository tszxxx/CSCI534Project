I be drive in my car 
I turn on the radio 
I be pull you close 
you just say no 
you say you do not like it 
but girl I know you be a liar 
cause when we kiss 
ooooh Fire 
late at night 
I be takin you home 
when I say I want to stay 
you say you want to be alone 
you say you do not love I 
girl you can not hide you desire 
and when we kiss 
oh Fire 
Fire 
you have a hold on I right from the start 
it be a grip so tight I could not tear it apart 
my nerve all jumpin 
Actin like a fool 
well you kiss they burn 
but you heart stay cool 
Romeo and Juliet 
Samson and Delilah 
baby you can bet 
they love they do not deny 
you word say split 
but you word they lie 
cause when we kiss 
mmmmmm Fire 
Fire 
burnin in my soul 
it be out of control
