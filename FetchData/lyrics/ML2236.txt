[Verse 1]
For fear, my eyes are closed
I'll shut this out no more, embrace this
And I become the catalyst!
And now it swells in me
Smash all my defenses down
I'll take this
I'll let this fire consume me
[Refrain]
I will not, I will not!
I will not fall, I will not fail!
I pound the walls, I shake the cage!
I will not fall, I will not fail!
Let the, fire, consume, me!
[Verse 2]
This burning passion, it fills me with desire
And drives me, and it drives my cause
I'm filled with reasons, but reasons drive me further
Disdain for disbelief will stay the course
[Chorus]
Oh, let the fire consume me
Let the fire burn!
Let the courage flow through me
Let the fire burn!
[Refrain]
I pound the walls, I shake the cage
I will not fall, I will not fail
I pound the walls, I shake the cage
I will not fall, I will not fail
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh, let the fire consume me
Let the fire burn!
Let the courage flow through me
Let the fire burn!
[Outro]
Let the, fire, consume, me!
