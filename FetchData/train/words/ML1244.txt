I lose you you slip from you costume like a actress in this tragedy you be just a apparition in a haunt mystery I fear that you have pass over I and there 's nothing I can do because I lose you just like a rich man who be careless of he change I take you for grant and then you go to stranger from deep within my heart I feel a distant fad pulse a poor woman look for last coin in she purse just like a counterfeit you pass from palm to palm I chase the one I surely love to someone else 's arm I mislaid my sense , now that 's easy to say a fool who take he pleasure but then throw he love away
