I will have a blue Christmas without you 
I will be so blue just think about you 
decoration of red on a green Christmas tree 
will not be the same dear if you be not here with I 
and when the blue snowflake start fall 
that be when those blue memory start call 
you will be do alright with you Christmas of white 
but I will have a blue Christmas 
you will be do alright with you Christmas of white 
but I will have a blue blue Christmas
