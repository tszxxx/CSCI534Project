you cheatin 's heart 
will make you weep 
you will cry and cry 
and try to sleep 
but sleep will not come 
the whole night through 
you cheatin 's heart 
will tell on you 
when tear come down 
like fall rain 
you will toss around 
and call my name 
you will walk the floor 
the way I do 
you cheatin 's heart 
will tell on you 
you cheatin 's heart 
will pine some day 
and crave the love 
you throw away 
the time will come 
when you will be blue 
you cheatin 's heart 
will tell on you 
when tear come down 
like fall rain 
you will toss around 
and call my name 
you will walk the floor 
the way I do 
you cheatin 's heart 
will tell on you 
songwriter Hank Williams sr
