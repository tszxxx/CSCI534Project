pretty bird pretty bird 
why you so still 
pretty bird pretty bird 
we have be wait on you 
you go west for the black setting sun 
you go south to the white spirit world 
you go east for those real green eye 
you go north walk the good red road 
pretty bird 
if there be a mirror in heaven 
pretty bird pretty bird 
there be a window on earth 
you go west for the black setting sun 
you go south to the white spirit world 
you go east for those real green eye 
you go north walk the good red road 
pretty bird 
Sun pity I yeah

star pity I 
for the blood of the pretty

the blood of the pretty bird 
pretty bird pretty bird

you go west for the black setting sun 
you go south to the white spirit world 
you go east for those real green eye 
you go north walk the good red road 
pretty bird
