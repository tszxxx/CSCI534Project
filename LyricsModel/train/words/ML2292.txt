wafe wash over everything on the ground 
the sun 's reflection block by a sound 
the sound of life just as it be rip apart 
I would say these word to you but fear that my heart would stay away 
you take my hand so I show you the place 
now it be grow empty you can see it in my face 
then the sound and it rip I in half 
who would say these thing to you if it be not mean to last not today 
love love love love love love love love 
what come out nail you head to the floor 
I say I be sorry as I be walk out the door 
love love love love love love love love
