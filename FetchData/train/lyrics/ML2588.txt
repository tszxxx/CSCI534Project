Warhead
Hear the thunder roar
Warhead
Unite the lightning whore
Power burning, hell and man
Raging torment, take my hand
Frenzied motions, reach your soul
Dance the warhead, fast or slow
Warhead
Hear the thunder roar
Warhead
Unite the lightning whore
Born of thunder
Raised by fire
Call the Heavens
By desire
Warhead
Hear the thunder roar
Warhead
Unite the lightning whore
Screaming furnace, death of life
Demons calling, chosen wives
Sabbaths charming, out in lust
Chance the warhead, win or bust
Warhead
Hear the thunder roar
Warhead
Unite the lightning whore
Warhead
Engraved on flesh and bone
Warhead
Born of mortal stone
