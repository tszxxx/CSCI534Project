[Verse 1]
Love is real
Real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
Love is touch
Touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
[Bridge]
Love is you, you and me
Love is knowing we can be
[Verse 2]
Love is free
Free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved
