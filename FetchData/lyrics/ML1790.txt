[Verse: Jenny Lewis]
I left while you were sleeping
While Abraham shaped your sigh
Never loved you less, never loved you more
As when Sirius hung in the sky
[Chorus: Jenny Lewis]
A memory is a memory
And a dream is a liar
Was I a man dreaming I was a lamb?
Or am I sleeping in clover tonight?
[Bridge: Jenny Lewis]
While men are dreaming
They know it not a dream
Upon waking, we're fools again
What if we're sleeping?
[Chorus: Jenny Lewis]
A memory is a memory
And a dream is a liar
Was I a woman to never see you again?
Or am I dreaming asleep by your side?
