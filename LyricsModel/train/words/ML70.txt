Sun tan toe tickle the sand 
cold drink chill in my right hand 
watchin you sleep in the evening light 
rest up for a long long night 
because when the sun go down we will be groove 
when the sun go down we will be feel all right 
when the sun sink down over the water 
everything get hotter when the sun go down 
all day long just takin it easy 
lay in the hammock where it be nice and breezy 
sleep off the night before 
cause when the sun go down we will be back for more 
because when the sun go down we will be groove 
when the sun go down we will be feel all right 
when the sun sink down over the water 
everything get hotter when the sun go down 
this old guitar and my dark sunglass 
this sweet concoction be smooth as molass 
nothing to do but breathe all day 
until the big moon rise and it be time to play 
because when the sun go down we will be groove 
when the sun go down we will be feel all right 
when the sun sink down over the water 
everything get hotter when the sun go down 
we will be feel alright 
when the sun sink down over the water 
uncle Kennys 's hotter when the sun go down 
because when the sun go down we will be groove 
when the sun go down we will be feel all right 
when the sun sink down over the water 
everything get hotter when the sun go down
