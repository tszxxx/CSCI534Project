[Verse]
You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darling
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all my money
And that's why you're my pride and joy
And I'm telling the world
You're my (Pride and joy) pride and joy (Pride and joy)
I believe I'm no (Baby boy) baby boy (Baby boy)
But I know you're mine (Pride and joy)
My pride and joy (Pride and joy)
Yeah baby (Baby boy) Yeah baby (Baby boy)
You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up (Pick me up) when I'm down (When I'm down)
And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town (Whole town)
And that's why (That's why)
I believe you're my (You're my) pride and joy (Pride and joy)
[Outro]
(Pride and joy)
(Pride and joy)
(Pride and joy)
(Pride and joy)
(Baby boy)
(Baby boy)
(Pride and joy) My pride and joy (Pride and joy)
And I love you like a baby loves his toy (Pride and joy)
