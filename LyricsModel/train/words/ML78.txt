Midnight gettin uptight where be you

I know I be hangin but I be still wantin you 
hey Jack it be a fact they be talkin in town 
I turn my back and you be messin around 
I be not really jealous do not like lookin like a clown 
I think of you every night and day 
you take my heart and you take my pride away 
I hate myself for love you 
can not break free from the thing that you do 
I want to walk but I run back to you 
that be why I hate myself for love you

but I have be dreamin' bout the lovin you do 
I be will not be as angry bout the hell you put I through 
hey man bet you can treat I right

I want to see you beg say forget it just for spite 
I think of you every night and day 
you take my heart and you take my pride away 
I hate myself for love you 
can not break free from the thing that you do 
I want to walk but I run back to you 
that be why I hate myself for love you

I think of you every night and day 
you take my heart and you take my pride away 
I hate myself for love you 
can not break free from the thing that you do 
I want to walk but I run back to you 
that be why I hate myself for love you
