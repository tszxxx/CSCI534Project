She's tired of loving me, she told me so
I guess she don't know just how much she means to me
But along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
Oh lord you just don't know how it hurts to say goodbye
She did her best to stay I can't say she did not try
I just hope the road she takes leads back to me
So along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
Yes I'm sitting free even thou I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm sitting fancy-free
