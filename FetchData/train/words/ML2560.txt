again we stalk the stage at mach speed we engage Feeding people 's rage the big cat 's leave its cage back in the bus again to catch another plane this behaviour 's quite insane but we do it for the fame I lose my mind , I lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road I lose my mind , I lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road the road will never end it always start again another show 's around the bend another long - lose friend , oh faceless as the snow there 's nothing special about the road it 's just another haul it 's just too damn long , that 's all I lose my mind , I lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road I lose my mind , I lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road lose my mind , I lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road I lose my mind , lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road I lose my mind , lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road I lose my mind , lose all my money I lose my life to the kill road
