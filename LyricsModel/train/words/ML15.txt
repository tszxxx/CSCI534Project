I love how you eye close 
whenever you kiss I 
and when I be away from you 
I love how you miss I 
I love the way 
you always treat I tenderly 
but darl most of all 
I love how you love I 
I love how you heart beat 
whenever I hold you 
I love how you think of I 
without be tell to 
I love the way 
you touch be always heavenly 
but darl most of all 
I love how you love I 
I love how you eye close 
whenever you kiss I 
and when I be away from you 
I love how you miss I 
I love the way 
you touch be always heavenly 
but darl most of all 
I love how you love I 
I love how you hug I 
I love how you squeeze I tease I please I 
love how you love I 
I love how you love I
