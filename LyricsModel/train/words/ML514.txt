deep be the love 
love that be deep within the sea 
lift I high 
high as the eagle in the sky 
soar above the cloud 
where I can find the sea 
closer to you I feel 
you love surround I 
like the color green 
you be in every stream 
you be in everything 
even in my dream 
you be my color green 
you be my favorite thing 
like the song I sing 
what a precious thing 
great be you love 
touch the deepest part of I 
you open my heart 
reveal to I the mystery 
you never grow old to I 
with you each day be new 
for all that you have do for I 
I give my life to you you 
like the color green 
you be in every stream 
you be in everything 
even in my dream 
you be my color green 
you be my favorite thing 
like the song I sing 
what a precious thing 
like the color green 
you be in every stream 
you be in everything 
even in my dream 
you be my color green 
my favorite thing 
like a song I sing 
what a precious thing 
you be my color green 
you be in every stream 
what a precious thing 
like the color green yes 
you be in everything 
like the color green 
you be in every stream 
you be in everything 
even in my dream
