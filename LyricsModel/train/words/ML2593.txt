long day slow waste 
see lie sow hate 
so many year to clean the slate 
endless despair within its wake 
he touch soiling what use to be clean 
he gaze burn on the edge of we dream 
no more 
long day long day 
and again he ride in 
it be September and he covet the gullible 
skeletal wish hunter 
a thousand lie cast from the throne of secrecy 
hear he spew forth a meaning to miserable lie 
see the twist hand of doubt seal the affair 
the insect trust believer 
you body a vehicle to house he disease 
pearl before swine they be nothing but blind 
submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn 
invisible king die 
procession of woe strike down by sorrow 
a burden so great weigh heavy on old and wither belief 
the swift solution crumble 
beneath the mock note of a masterpiece 
death in he eye waiting 
spirale judgment provoke in the rain 
this futile test drow in the levee of deception 
this futile test drow in the levee of deception 
in the year of he sovereign 
rid we of you judgment 
heir apparent
