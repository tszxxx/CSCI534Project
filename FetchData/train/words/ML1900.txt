when you be here I long for all those thing my eye would steal like a thief and hide from you when it rain on this town and in this heart I betray the one I have come to love the most when I be down and most of all I have have have come to get revenge on all I have do but I be sad and we love be far behind I long for all that time I spend with you when I be go like a rave in the grave young lover sure will not spring from these evil seed play with fire play with you sometimes
