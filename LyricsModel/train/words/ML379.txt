pain without love 
pain I can not get enough 
pain I like it rough 
cause I would rather feel pain than nothing at all

you be not the only one 
I will take you by the hand 
and I will show you a world that you can understand 
this life be fill with hurt 
when happiness do not work 
trust I and take my hand 
when the light go out you will understand 
pain without love

cause I would rather feel pain than nothing at all 
pain without love 
pain I can not get enough 
pain I like it rough 
cause I would rather feel pain than nothing at all 
anger and agony 
be better than misery 
trust I I have get a plan 
when the light go up you will understand 
pain without love

that I be here to save you
