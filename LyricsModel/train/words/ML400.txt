there be a silence here between we 
I have never hear before 
and I can not find the love 
in she eye anymore 
there be some change go on 
I be begin to understand 
when I be hold she 
I swear I feel the presence of another man 
there be a stranger in my house 
somebody here that I can not see 
stranger in my house 
somebody here try to take she away from I 
she sit stare out the window 
a million mile away 
and when I ask if she be all right 
she never have too much to say 
be it somebody we both know 
or somebody she just meet 
be she love he in she mind 
while she be lie here in my bed 
there be a stranger in my house 
somebody here that I can not see 
stranger in my house 
somebody here try to take she away from I 
suspicion lead to question 
and question to alibis 
be it just my imagination 
or have she love turn into lie 
there be a stranger in my house 
somebody be here that I can not see 
stranger in my house 
somebody here try to take she away 
stranger in my house 
somebody be here that I can not see 
stranger in my house 
somebody here try to take she away 
stranger in my house 
somebody here try to take she away from I
