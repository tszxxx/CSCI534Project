[Verse 1]
There might have been things I missed
But don't be unkind
It don't mean I'm blind
Perhaps there's a thing or two
I think of, lying in bed
I shouldn't have said
But there it is
[Chorus]
You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here
From the beginning
[Verse 2]
Maybe I might've changed
And not been so cruel
Not been such a fool
Whatever was done is done
I just can't recall
It doesn't matter at all
[Chorus]
You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here
From the beginning
[Instrumental Outro]
