dangerous feeling break out my soul 
it be just the meaning of be alone 
I need you here wherever you be 
I need you now to take I so far 
I want to run like the speed of the sound 
I be somewhere I feel you around 
you give I now the meaning of life 
with you I be feel alive 
why you be lookin like that 
I be burn like fire 
I want to be higher 
just let I know 
why you be lookin like that 
you be drive I crazy 
you be lookin amazing 
Go! 
why you be lookin like that 
I be burn like fire 
I want to be higher 
just let I know 
why you be lookin like that 
you be drive I crazy 
you be lookin amazing 
why you be lookin like that 
I be burn like fire 
I want to be higher 
just let I know 
why you be lookin like that 
you be drive I crazy 
you be lookin amazing 
why you be lookin like that 
I be burn like fire 
I want to be higher 
just let I know 
why you be lookin like that 
you be drive I crazy 
you be lookin amazing
