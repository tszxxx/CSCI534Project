When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up from another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road once again it seems
All that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
And how I wish that love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have 'cause I've got so much to give
But you know I feel so sad down inside my heart
That the dollar signs should be keeping us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent, so I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this traveling life, well, it's the only life I know
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh how I love you
