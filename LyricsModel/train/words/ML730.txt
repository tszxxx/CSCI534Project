I live the same old dream 
day and night 
memory of love I know 
I could not live my life or so it seem 
my heart cry out for only you 
oh I believe in love 
but I believe in you 
thing you do 
I be fall in love again with you 
a broken heart could mend if give time 
I know why love be forever 
love be forever with you 
if every passing day I realize 
and time will never heal the pain 
you be all I have be think of 
everyone will fall in love again 
I believe in love 
I believe in you 
thing you do 
I be fall in love again with you 
a broken heart can mend if give time 
I know why love be forever 
love be forever with you 
every road will lead I back to you again 
my love 
oh I cry so many tear 
I have be face all the day without you 
so tell I you care 
oh I believe in love 
I believe in you 
thing you do 
I be fall in love again with you 
try to let it go but it would not die 
I know why love be forever 
love be forever with you
