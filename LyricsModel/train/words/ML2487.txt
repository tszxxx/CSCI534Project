I give she all my love 
that be all I do 
and if you see my love 
you would love she too 
I love she 
she give I everything 
and tenderly 
the kiss my lover bring 
she bring to I 
and I love she 
a love like ours 
could never die 
as long as I 
have you near I 
Bright be the star that shine 
Dark be the sky 
I know this love of mine 
will never die 
and I love she 
Bright be the star that shine 
Dark be the sky 
I know this love of mine 
will never die 
and I love she
