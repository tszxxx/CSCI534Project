just off of the beaten path 
a little dot on a state road map 
that be where I be bear and where I will die 
thing move at a slower pace 
nobody be in the rat race 
and these day that be a special way of life 
down home 
where they know you by name and treat you like family 
down home 
a man 's good word and a handshake be all you need 
folk know 
if they be fallin on hard time they can fall back on 
those of we raise up down home 
in the corner of the hardware store 
gather round a checker board 
old man tellin lie and crownin king 
kid drivin' round the old town square 
cop roll down in the cool night air 
go and see what be shakin at the Dairy Queen 
down home 
where they know you by name and treat you like family 
down home 
a man 's good word and a handshake be all you need 
folk know 
if they be fallin on hard time they can fall back on 
those of we raise up down home 
when I be a boy I could not wait to leave this place 
but now I want to see my child raise 
down home 
down home 
folk know 
if there fallin on hard time they can fall back on 
those of we raise up 
down home 
where they know you by name and treat you like family 
down home 
a man 's good word and a handshake be all you need 
folk know 
if they be fallin on hard time they can fall back on 
those of we raise up down home 
down home 
Way down home 
down home 
down home 
Way down home 
down home
