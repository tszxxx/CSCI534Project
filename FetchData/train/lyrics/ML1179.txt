I'm scared to try cuz I'm scared to fail
I'm scared to die cuz I'm scared of hell
I'm scared to kiss scared to hug
I'm scared of sex cuz I'm scared to touch
I'm scared to look cuz I'm scared to see
I'm scared of you cuz I'm scared of me
I'm scared to fly cuz I'm scared to crash
I'm scared to move on so I live in the past
I'm scared to fight cuz I'm scared to bleed
I'm scared of love cuz I'm scared he'll live
I'm scared of drugs I'm scared to drink
I'm scared to swim cuz I'm scared to sink
I'm scared to learn cuz I'm scared of truth
Don't wanna gain weight cuz I'm scared of food
I'm scared to think that the label dropped me
I'm scared to think of my album floppin'
This may sound silly but it's true
So don't pretend it ain't you too
We all afraid of something here
Cuz you ain't human with out fear
I'm scared to start cuz I'm scared I'll quit
I'm scared that people won't like my shit
I'm scared of fame and paparazzi
Rumors startin' and people watching
Scared to grow up cuz I'm scared to get old
Scared of the dark and being alone
I'm scared of war I'm scared of jail
Scared to share a secret cuz I'm scared you'll tell
This may sound silly but it's true
So don't pretend it ain't you too
We all afraid of something here
Cuz you ain't human with out fear
