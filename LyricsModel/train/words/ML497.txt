lie in my bed I hear the clock tick 
and I think of you 
catch up in circle 
confusion be nothing new 
flashback warm night 
almost leave behind 
suitcase of memory 
time after 
sometimes you picture I 
and I be walk too far ahead 
you be call to I and I can not hear 
what you have say 
then you say go slow 
I fall behind 
the second hand unwind 
if you be lose you can look you will find I 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you I will be wait 
time after 
my picture fade and darkness have 
turn to gray 
watch through window you be wonder 
if I be ok 
secret steal from deep inside 
the drum beat out of time 
if you be lose you can look you will find I 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you I will be wait 
time after time 
mmm
