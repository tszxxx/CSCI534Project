[Verse 1]
If I could grant
You one wish
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you, baby
When you're driving me crazy
[Chorus]
Ooh, I love the way you (You laugh and breathe)
Love the way you love me (And smile when you touch me)
There's nowhere else I'd rather be (Drives me wild)
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me (I melt and spin and fall again)
I only wish that you could see
The way you love me (Love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me
[Verse 2]
It's not right
It's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you
[Chorus]
Ooh, I love the way you (You laugh and breathe)
Love the way you love me (And smile when you touch me)
There's nowhere else I'd rather be (Drives me wild)
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me (I melt and spin and fall again)
I only wish that you could see
The way you love me (Love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me
[Bridge]
You're the million reasons why
There's love reflecting in my eyes
[Chorus]
Ooh, I love the way you (You laugh and breathe)
Love the way you love me (And smile when you touch me)
There's nowhere else I'd rather be (Drives me wild)
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me (I melt and spin and fall again)
I only wish that you could see
The way you love me (Love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me (Love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me (Love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me
[Outro]
Oh, the way you love me
Ooh, I love the way you love me
The way you love me
Ooh, I love the way you love me
Oh, yeah
Ooh, I love the way you love me
Whoa, whoa, whoa
