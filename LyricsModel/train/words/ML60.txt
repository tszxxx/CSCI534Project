last night be shake and pretty loud 
my cat be pur it scratch my skin 
so what be wrong with another sin 
the bitch be hungry she need to tell 
so give she inch and feed she well 
more day to come new place to go 
I have get to leave it be time for a show

my body be burn it start to shout 
desire be come it break out loud 
lust be in cage 's til storm break loose 
just have to make it with someone I choose 
the night be call I have to go 
the wolf be hungry he run the show 
he be lick he lip he be ready to win 
on the hunt tonight for love at First Sting

it be early morning the sun come out 
last night be shake and pretty loud 
my cat be pur it scratch my skin 
so what be wrong with another sin 
the night be call I have to go 
the wolf be hungry he run the show 
he be lick he lip he be ready to win 
on the hunt tonight for love at first sting 
here I be 
rock you like a hurricane
