[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
[Bridge]
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're having a good time
[Bridge]
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
[Verse 3]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
[Bridge]
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
[Verse 4]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind Pa
[Bridge]
She's 68, but she says she's 54
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
[Verse 5]
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
[Bridge]
They say "Sing while you slave" and I just get bored
Ah, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
