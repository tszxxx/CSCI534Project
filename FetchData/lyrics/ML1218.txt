Why let this world just wait on your shoulders?
Pick it up, push it off, before you let yourself get colder
Just look into the eyes, the good eyes of a child
And see that love rise like a river and float for a thousand miles
Gimme some
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, and happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, and happiness)
Alright now
Come on get to me
Breathin' deep, feel your heart beat
Just to know that life's worth living
Feel your feet on the earth, you better love it while it's still here spinning
I got no time to worry about troubles on ...
You gotta let it flow, let yourself go
Cause if you're hatin, you sure ain't living
Gimme some
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Come on get to me
Lookee here-
Lotta people talking, somebody to listen
Lotta people struggling
Gotta ring the bells (?) start giving
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Come on, now
You gotta give it up!
I go and eat this daily bread
But so many people starving
How come the presidents just build more bombs
When nations start dissolving?
With all that money spent on guns 'stead of food and education
Need to buy a little peace and love instead, start the healing of the nation
Gimme some
Peace love happiness x20
