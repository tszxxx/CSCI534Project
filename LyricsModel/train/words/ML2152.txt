what 
star can not fight city light 
they have turn they back on we 
it be true today I see it from the plane 
aeroplane be never build to fly 
down down down down 
down down down down down dow and 
do not look down 
do not look now 
crosshair of we shadow trace the dam 
tell that there be people trap alive 
Boulder City look like coal in the fire 
Cabin 's perch by satellite 
and now we be fly blind 
we have get a lady pilot 
she be not afraid to die 
it be true today I see it from the plane 
we have almost finish reel in the sky 
power line once lace the heaven 
Pima County look like coal in the fire
