in a bed of Kleenex 
stuff chocolate in my mouth 
on the phone with my best friend 
cuss my ex 
he break my heart 
feel like the world have end 
I cry myself to sleep 
think I can not get over he 
strange talk about luck 
I wake up and the sun be shine 
strange I ought to be in bed 
with my head in the pillow crying 
over we but I hate hate love 
strange 
get half a mind 
to spend my whole pay check 
on one of those dress 
the strapless black one 
that be so famous 
for teaching lesson 
Drop by he place 
pick up the rest of my thing 
he will tell I I look good 
I will laugh and say yeah 
strange talk about luck 
I wake up and the sun be shine 
strange I ought to be in bed 
with my head in the pillow crying 
over we but I hate hate love 
strange strange 
strange talk about luck 
I wake up and the sun be shine 
strange I ought to be in bed 
with my head in the pillow crying 
over we but I hate hate love 
strange 
strange talk about luck 
I wake up and the sun be shine 
strange strange
