Stay around don't play around
This old town and all
Seems like I got to travel on
A lotta people won't get no supper tonight
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
The battle is gettin' hotter
In this iration, Armagideon time
A lotta people runnin' and a'hidin' tonight
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
I (?)
They both are comin' through
(A lotta people ?)
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
It's Armagideon
It's not Christmas time any more, Armagideon
A lotta people need...
(All right, time's up! Let's have you out of there!)
Ok, ok! Don't push us when we're hot!
A lotta people won't a'get no supper tonight
A lotta people sittin' down by the light
A lotta people won't a'get no supper tonight
A lotta people won't a'get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
Armagideon time
