I do not know how to explain it 
but I know the word would hardly do 
miracle and sign and wonder 
be not enough for I to prove to you 
do not you know I have always love you 
even before there be time 
though you turn away 
I tell you still 
do not you know I have always love you 
and I always will 
greater love have not a man 
than the one who give he life to prove 
that he would do anything 
and that be what I be go to do for you 
do not you know I have always love you 
even before there be time 
though you turn away 
I tell you still 
do not you know I have always love you 
and I always will 
do not you know I have always love you 
even before there be time 
though you turn away 
I tell you still 
do not you know I have always love you 
do not you know I have always love you 
even before there be time 
though you turn away 
I tell you still 
do not you know I have always love you 
and I always will 
I have always love you oh 
and I always will 
I have always love you 
and I always will 
I have always love you oh 
and I always and I always will 
I have always love you
