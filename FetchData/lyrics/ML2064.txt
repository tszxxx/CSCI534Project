Let my heart be changed renewed
Flowing from the grace that I found
In You
Lord I've come to know
The weakness I see in me
Will be stripped away
By the power of Your love
Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Oh Lord
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side
And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
With the power of Your love
With the power of Your love
With the power of Your love
Lord unveil my eyes
Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love as You live
In me
(Lord renew)
Lord renew my mind
As Your will unfolds my life
In living every day
Oh Lord
By the power of Your love
Hold me close
Let Your love
Surround, surround
Oh surround me oh Lord
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side
Draw me to Your side
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
With the power of Your love
Hold me close
Oh let Your love
Surround, surround
Oh surround me
Bring me near
(Draw me to Your side)
Draw me to Your side
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
The eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
