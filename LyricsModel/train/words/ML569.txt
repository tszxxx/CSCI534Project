Blue you radiant blue 
I do not know how you can stand next to I 
you you talk like a noose 
and only confuse my perplexity 
now that I be so sad and not quite right 
I could dance all night 
I could dance all night 
shake you rattle snake skin 
and become a part of society 
wait on down the highway 
to see how far I will come a-run a-run 
run running 
all that we have salvage from the fire 
be a waste of time 
what a waste of time 
should I trust all the rust that be on tv 
I guess with some distaste I disagree 
with quite a fashionable dispassion for 
the dispossess under-stressed 
gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme 
and I do not care if you do not like it 
or just do not see 
now that we fatten the cow 
and set out to plow unknown enemy 
wow shout the startle crowd 
how now do you see what I do see 
the ravage cabbage drift on dark red sky 
and it look so nice 
gee it look so nice 
shout just let it on out 
confusion become a philosophy 
down we be reach the town where we 
do not have to stand around and look 
over we shoulder 
Hell I never know be what we make it 
let 's just take it slow in this home on ice
