now there 's something come through the air that softly remind I tonight I will park out on the hill and wait until they find I you be slipping through the ether , a voice be come through so keep I in you heart tonight and I will save my love for you so turn up you radio and darling dial I in close we be riding on the airwave and we be travel coast to coast over river and highway you voice come clear and true though we be far apart tonight , I will save my love for you hold I in you arm and we doubt will not break we if we open up we heart , love will not forsake we just let the music take we and carry we home there 's a prayer come through the air and it 's shot straight through my heart tear open the evening sky and tear I apart now I will ride that signal down the line till I be home again with you so turn up you radio and I will save my love for you turn up you radio and I will save my love for you
