oh there be other and some be friend 
and some be merrily lover 
but they all help I discover 
it be so hard to find someone who will be true 
and I say no way would I fall again oh no no way 
there be just too many heartach 
and I do not like the way it feel to feel my heart break 
then there be you 
you be the best break this old heart ever have 
you be all the good luck that I will never need to have 
never think I would ever love again like that 
you be the best break this old heart ever have 
all around I 
my world be crumble down all around I 
oh but then you find I 
and with you love you mend my life 
you be the best break this old heart ever have 
you be all the good luck that I will never need to have 
never think I would ever love again like that 
you be the best break this old heart ever have 
you be the best break this old heart ever have 
you be all the good luck that I will never need to have 
never think I would ever love again like that 
you be the best break this old heart ever have 
you be the best break this old heart ever have
