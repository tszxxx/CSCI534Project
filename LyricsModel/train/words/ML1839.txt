Blue sky 
smil at I 
nothing but 
Blue sky 
do i see 
bluebird 
sing a song 
nothing but 
bluebird 
all day long 
never see the sun 
shine so bright 
never see thing 
go so right 
notice the day 
Hurryng by 
when you be in love 
my how the fly 
Blue day 
all of they go 
nothing but 
Blue sky 
from now on
