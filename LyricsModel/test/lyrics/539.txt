She like the theatre and never comes late
She never bothers with people she hates
That's why the lady is a tramp
Doens't like crapgames with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
Tha'ts why the lady is a tramp
She like the free fresh wind in her hain, life without care
She's broke and it's oke
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
She loves the theatre, but never comes late
She'd never bother with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
She'll have no crapgames with sharpies and frogs
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads
That's why the lady is a tramp
She loves the free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care. She's broke but it's oke
Hates California, it's so cold and so damp
That's why the lady. that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp
