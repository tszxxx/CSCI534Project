[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning feeling fine
'Cause there was something special on my mind
Last night I met a new boy in the neighborhood
Whoa yeah
[Chorus]
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
[Verse 2]
He's kind of quiet, not too shy
And I can tell he's my kind of guy
He danced every slow dance with me like I hoped he would
(He danced with me like I hoped he would, now)
[Chorus]
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
[Bridge]
We only talked for a minute or two
And it felt like I knew him the whole night through
I don't know if people fall in love
But he's everything I've been dreaming of
He's everything I've been dreaming of
[Verse 3]
When he walked me home and he held my hand
Knew it wouldn't be just a one-night stand
'Cause he asked to see me next week and I told him he could
(He asked to see me) Whoa yeah
(And I told him he could, well)
[Chorus]
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
[Sax and organ]
[Verse 4]
When he walked me home and he held my hand
Knew it wouldn't be just a one-night stand
'Cause he asked to see me next week and I told him he could
(He asked to see me and I told him he could, well)
[Outro]
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
Something goooood, oh yeah
Something good
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
Something good, something good
Something good
(Something tells me I'm into something goooood)
