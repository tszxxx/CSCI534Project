heifer whine could be human cry 
closer come the scream knife 
this beautiful creature must die 
this beautiful creature must die 
a death for no reason 
and death for no reason be murder 
and the flesh you so fancifully fry 
be not succulent tasty or kind 
it be death for no reason 
and death for no reason be murder 
and the calf that you carve with a smile 
it be murder 
and the turkey you festively slice 
it be murder 
do you know how animal die 
Kitchen aroma be not very homely 
it be not comforting cheery or kind 
it be sizzle blood and the unholy stench of murder 
it be not natural normal or kind 
the flesh you so fancifully fry 
the meat in you mouth 
as you savour the flavour of murder 
no no no it be murder 
no no no it be murder 
oh and who hear when animal cry
