[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Working on the weekend, baby
She's working all through the night
A jump into the deep end gave her
The evidence she required
Takes five, she's got pearls
Don't fake it when it comes to making money
So she smiles, but that's cruel
If you know what she thinks
If you knew what she was after
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sometimes she wonders
And she laughs in her frustration
[Chorus]
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the 
Skin Trade
[Verse 2]
Doctors of the revolution gave us
The medicine we desired
Besides being absolutely painless
It's a question of compromise
They got steel
So cool to get angry at the weekend
And go back to school
So big deal, it's what rule
When it comes to making money
Say yes, please, thank you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sometimes you wonder
And ask yourself the question
[Chorus]
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade
[Instrumental]
[Hook]
I know the answer
But you asking the question
[Chorus]
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade
[Chorus-Outro]
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade
Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade...
