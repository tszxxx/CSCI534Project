I will never smile again 
until I smile at you 
I will never laugh again 
what good would it do 
for tear would fill my eye 
my heart would realize 
that we romance be through 
I will never love again 
I be so in love with you 
I will never thrill again 
to somebody new 
within my heart 
I know I would never start 
to smile again 
until I smile at you 
within my heart 
I know I would never start 
to smile again 
until I smile at you 
until I smile at you
