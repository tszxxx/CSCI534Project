[Chorus:]
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
[Verse 1:]
We've both been sound asleep
Wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over
It's four o'clock
And we're in trouble deep
[Chorus:]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
[Verse 2:]
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell all our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"
[Chorus:]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
[Verse 3:]
Well, I told your mama that
You'd be in by ten
Well, Susie, baby
Looks like we goofed again
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
We gotta go home
[Chorus:]
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
[Verse 4:]
The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep
Our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot
[Chorus:]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
[Verse 5:]
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"
[Chorus:]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
