get no reason now for goin home 
all my reason be now she be go 
get no one there to talk to 
and even though I know I ought to 
get no reason now for goin home 
once I have ev'ry reason a man could want 
for goin home and makin love but now I do not 
so I end up in here each night sittin and a-thinkin 
missin she hurtin so and drinkin 
get no reason now for goin home 
all my reason be now she be go 
get no one there to talk to 
and even though I know I ought to 
get no reason now for goin home 
it be so hard now just knowin there be another 
that she be out with he knowin that I love she 
so I end up in here each night sittin and a-thinkin 
missin she hatin he and drinkin 
get no reason now for goin home 
all my reason be now she be go 
get no one there to talk to 
and even though I know I ought to 
get no reason now for goin home
