pair of boot and a sack of clothes 
free and easy down the road I go 
hang memory on the high line pole 
free and easy down the road I go 
free and easy down the road I go 
ragweed be rock on the radio 
free and easy down the road I go 
so I keep roll like a old banjo 
free and easy down the road I go 
get the sun shine on I like a big spotlight 
so I know everything be go to be alright 
be not no tell where the wind might blow 
free and easy down the road I go 
live life like a Sunday stroll 
free and easy down the road I go 
free and easy down the road I go 
if you only get to go around one time 
I be go to sit back and try to enjoy the ride 
I could make a million or wind up break 
free and easy down the road I go 
can not take it with you when you go so 
free and easy down the road I go 
someday I know it be go to take I home so 
free and easy down the road I go 
free and easy down the road I go
