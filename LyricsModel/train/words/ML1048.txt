maybe I hang around here 
a little more than I should 
we both know I get 
somewhere else to go 
but I get something to tell you 
that I never think I would 
but I believe you really ought to know 
I love you 
I honestly love you 
you do not have to answer 
I see it in you eye 
maybe it be better leave unsaid 
this be pure and simple 
and you must realize 
that it be come from my heart 
and not my head 
I love you 
I honestly love you 
I be not try to make you feel uncomfortable 
I be not try to make you 
anything at all 
but this feeling 
do not come along everyday 
and you should not blow the chance 
when you have get the chance to say 
I love you 
I honestly love you 
if we both be bear 
in another place and time 
this moment might be end in a kiss 
but there you be with yours 
and here I be with mine 
so I guess we will just be leave it at this 
I love you 
I honestly love you 
I honestly love you
