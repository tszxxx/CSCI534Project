[Verse 1]
You hit me just like heroin
I feel you coursing through my veins
I once tried to kick this addiction
I swear I'll never kick again, won't ever kick again, no
[Chorus]
This addiction
Can't seem to live without you
This addiction
No going clean
This addiction
Go through withdrawal without you
Sick with this addiction in me
[Verse 2]
Well those others were like methadone
I took to get me through the day
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Staying clean along the way
Hold out for the real thing yeah
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
This addiction
This addiction
This addiction
I go off the rails without you
Sick with this addiction in me
