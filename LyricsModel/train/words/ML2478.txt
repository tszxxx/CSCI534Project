search for home 
leave all alone 
life on a stroll 
love come and go 's 
when will it end 
nobody know I choose my road 
I know I be a long way from home 
search for home 
maybe I be wrong 
I know what I feel 
somewhere it be out there 
in it I be real 
but when will it end 
nobody know I choose my road 
I know I be a long way from home 
search for home 
my home 
search for home 
and you say the journy just footstep home 
in my head I will never be alone 
and you say my life will tell a story 
but I be still none the wiser and I can not understand 
search for home 
leave all alone 
I choose my road 
I know I be a long way from home 
search for home 
my home 
I be all alone 
search for home
