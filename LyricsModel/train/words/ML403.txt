they say that it be a matter of trusting 
before love have a chance to begin 
and it be never simple 
faithless heart can cripple 
and only a strong love survive 
I know they say that it be such a fine line 
between give up and give in 
but once you heart be be in it 
you just can not forget it 
it be like nothing that you have feel in you life

real love we heart 's celebration 
I love you you know I love you too 
real love not a imitation 
real love you be my destination 
baby you and I we get everything we need 
you be such a part of my life 
that I can not remember I without you 
and we have have we night 
we have have we share of fight 
but we have never think of give it up 
oh you and I we must be dreamer 
because we be make all we dream come true 
I could spend my life 
just hold you so tight 
and never ever get enough 
we get real love not infatuation 
real love we heart 's celebration 
I love you you know I love you too 
we get real love not a imitation
