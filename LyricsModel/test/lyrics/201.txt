[Verse]
Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Sleep in Heavenly peace
