tell I exactly what be I suppose to do 
now that I have allow you to beat I 
do you think that we could play another game 
maybe I can win this time 
I kind of like the misery you put I through 
darling you can trust I completely 
if you even try to look the other way 
I think that I could kill this time 
rah rah 
rah rah 
it do not really seem I be get through to you 
though I see you weep so sweetly 
I think that you might have to take another taste 
a little bit of hell this time 
rah rah lie to I 
rah rah lie to I 
be she not right be she insane 
will she now run for she life in the battle that end this day 
be she not right be she insane 
will she now run for she life now that she lie to I 
you always want people to remember you 
to leave you little mark on society 
do not you know you wish be comin true today 
another victim die tonight 
rah rah lie to I 
rah rah lie to I 
be she not right be she insane 
will she now run for she life in the battle that end this day 
be she not right be she insane 
will she now run for she life now that she lie to I 
be she really tell lie again 
do not she realize she be in danger 
be she not right be she insane 
will she now run for she life in the battle that end this day 
be she not right be she insane 
will she now run for she life now that she lie to I 
the little bitch she go and she tell a lie 
and now she will never tell another lie 
the little bitch she go and she tell a lie 
never fuck lie to I
