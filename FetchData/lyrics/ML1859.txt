[Verse 1]
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Why you so still?
Pretty bird, pretty bird
We've been waiting on you
[Chorus]
You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road
Pretty bird
[Verse 2]
If there's a mirror in heaven
Pretty bird, pretty bird
There's a window on earth
[Chorus]
You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road
Pretty bird
[Bridge]
Sun pity me, yeah
Moon pity me, yeah
Stars pity me
For the blood of the pretty
The blood of the pretty
The blood of the pretty bird
[Verse 3]
Pretty bird, pretty bird
We're starving you still
[Chorus]
You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road
Pretty bird
