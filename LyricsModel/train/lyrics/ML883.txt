[Verse 1]
There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em
There's blood on the seas if you map 'em
Christian, if you see your papa, tell him I love him
He taught me to love in the wild and fight in the gym
He taught me the bottle gives birth to the cup
And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores
[Verse 2]
Sycamore got to grow down to grow up
Young roots toil the soil like baby's first cup
And when they bend you in two
And say too green for the fire
When all you want to do is be a part of the fire
All you want to do is be the fire part of fire
Like sycamores
[Verse 3]
There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em
There's blood on the seas if you map 'em
Christian, when I see your papa, I'll tell him you love him
And remember to love in the wild and fight in the gym
Remember the bottle gives birth to the cup
And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores
