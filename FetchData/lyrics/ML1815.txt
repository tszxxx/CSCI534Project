[Intro]
Well alright
Now dig this!
[Verse 1]
You don't care for me, I don't care about that
You got a new fool, huh? I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love with your fire?
[Chorus][x4]
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
[Verse 2]
Now listen to this baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom isn't home, it's not my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one burning desire
Oh, I'm going to do it in your fire
[Chorus][x4]
[Verse 3]
Oh, move over, over
And let Mr. Huckleberry take over
You know he's bad, you know he drowns, you know who he gives it to, yeah
That's right
Now dig this!
You try to give me your money
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire?
[Chorus][x4]
[Outro]
You better slide you ass over, girl
Because I'm coming through once and I'm coming the way you must be
