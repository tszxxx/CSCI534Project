[Verse 1: Travis]
I ain't never met a girl before
That came on in and shook up my life
Someone who'd make me give up everything
Go from broke and fall in love
And baby girl that's something
[Pre-Hook]
Oh, my heart, my time, it's nothing
Girl, oh, her kiss, just can't do with out it
Oh, there's something 'bout the things you do
Oh, and every time I think of you
I get excited 'cause you're my girl
[Hook]
(That girl)
Just the way I like it, gotta have it just the way
(That girl)
Keep me open, I be hopin' that I'm gonna be with
(That girl)

She's killing me, 
crazy, sexy, cool

[Verse 2: Kevin]
Nothing 'bout this girl is typical
Got body right out Vibe magazine
And she's just so incredible
She's the type of girl
That you might search your whole life for
[Pre-Hook]
Oh, my heart, my time, it's nothing
Girl, oh, her kiss, just can't do with out it
Oh, there's something 'bout the things you do
Oh, and every time I think of you
I get excited 'cause you're my girl
[Hook]

Baby, takes me high

Baby, but even if I try
