I do not know I do not know 
where I will go or what I will do 
it make no difference 
what I will do without you 
oh I love you my darling 
but I will try and let you be 
Goodbye it be the last 
you will hear of I 
well I find a bluebird 
high on a mountain side 
and the little bird 
would sing it 's little song 
so I will sigh I will cry 
I would even want to die 
for the one I love be go 
well I find a bluebird 
high on a mountain side 
and the little bird 
would sing it 's little song 
so I will sigh I will cry 
I would even want to die 
for the one that I love have go
