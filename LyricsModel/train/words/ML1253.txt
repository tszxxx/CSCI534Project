this be not you song 
this be not you music 
how can there be wrong 
when by committee they choose it all 
they choose it all 
to turn to turn 
you be go to grow old 
you be go to grow cold 
bear sign on the avenue 
for you own personal Waterloo 
you be bear sign on the avenue 
for you own personal Waterloo now 
we will fight we will fight 
we will fight for you music hall 
and die city 
they will fight they will fight 
they will fight for you neural wall 
and plasticity 
and precious territory 
this be not we song 
this be not even a musical 
I think life be too long 
to be a whale in a cubicle 
nail under you cuticle 
to turn to turn 
go to grow old 
you be go to grow so cold 
before this song can deliver you 
you be bear sign on the avenue 
you be bear sign 
for you own personal Waterloo now
