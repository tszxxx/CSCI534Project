you take hold of my affection 
with you Bible and you sword 
you celebrity connection 
I be not use to keep score 
from you fine guilded chalice 
I drank all you cheap red wine 
it be a good place to be Judas 
hide pearl from the swine 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun to you when I come 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun to you when I come 
you win I just as I fail you 
fist full of cake who could refuse 
all of my love get stick in traffic 
two thousand mile away from you 
bleed on into the telephone 
on a reupholster bed of nail 
I be a long long way from home 
I hope my jet lag heart do not fail 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun to you when I come 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun 
I will bring the sun to you when I come
