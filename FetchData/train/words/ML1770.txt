wake I up with laughter wrap I in you arm this be not no morning after never be so warm it do not take so long for we to feel this way can a good thing last longer than a day ? where do we take it now now that we catch fire ? will something greater grow out of this desire ? should I drop my guard at the risk of be use ? but the way you do those thing to I how can I refuse ? I could get addict to you energy the way you take I over pull on I we heart beat together we timing be the same can I trust my feeling save myself the pain ? where do we take it now now that we catch fire ? will something greater grow out of this desire ? should I drop my guard at the risk of be use ? but the way you do those thing to I how can I refuse ? we could share they mystery spare ourselves the misery discover it again every day we could take love all the way where do we take it now now that we catch fire ? will something greater grow out of this desire ? should I drop my guard at the risk of be use ? but the way you do those thing to I how can I refuse ?
