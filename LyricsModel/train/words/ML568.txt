when the number get so high 
of the dead fly through the sky 
o I do not know why 
love come to I 
love come to I 
when you mouth be lay ope 
head knock back you do not cope 
you be out of ring and flower and soap 
love come to I 
love come to I 
love come to I 
love come and all 
it be my hand my heart my lip 
and that be all 
when the fever hit on you forehead 
and trusive mouse chew up you bed 
and you call on God and God be dead 
love come to you 
love come to you 
o sugar will not you be my only 
I be a hard hearted honey pot hungry shepherd 
and I be long to be bear for you that be she 
love come to you 
love come and all 
it be you hand you heart you lip 
and that be all 
in the night time when you feel I 
and the back of you knee conceal I 
and you eyeball unreal I 
love come to I 
love come to I
