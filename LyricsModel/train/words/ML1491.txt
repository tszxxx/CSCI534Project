war 
do you hear revolution 's call 
it be time to fight we own denial 
warmonger keep we lock in fear 
invoke the past a moment of tear 
a ugly truth 
put forth by we you th 
under the threat of patriotic brute so 
use you rage 
it be a weapon 
we now must engage 
let trumpet sound we call 
or by they lie we will fall 
gnash down we tooth in hate and sing 
sing revolution 's song 
when they say die 
die for America 
war 
they say that freedom be not free 
it be pay with the life 
of son and family 
cause blood be they new currency 
and oil pump the heart of money 
so fight as one 
without a fuck gun 
word be the bullet to this revolution 
use you pain 
the battleground the street be ablaze 
excess will pave they path 
the wind of change we bloodbath 
gnash down we tooth in hate and sing 
sing revolution 's song 
when they say die 
die for America 
power and prejudice 
action they use to pit against 
terror insurgency 
word use to scare conformity 
it be propaganda it be they hypocrisy 
free to choose we own slavery 
all suffer humanity 
fight 
fight for all that you love 
scream choke with foot upon throat 
blind star spangle eye 
death no more the truth you will hide 
no more 
so how do they sleep 
while we mother weep 
they be sell we soul 
and we blood for oil 
we generation 
can be the fuck one 
that overcome the greed 
of corrupt nation 
have no shame 
you be not alone in think 
this be fuck insane 
rise up and take you stand 
and curl the finger of you hand 
and I do not know what to do 
cause I do not have the answer 
but with every ounce of strength 
I will vow to fight this cancer 
do not say I want to lead 
I just might let you dow and 
do not say believe in I 
just hold this common ground 
I be just as lose as you 
and probably more confused 
so fuck far from perfect 
my mind wreck from abuse 
there be something fuck wrong 
when war take son and daughter 
we lamb misl to slaughter 
war 
clench the fist of dissent 
lie 
clench the fist of dissent 
fear 
clench the fist of dissent 
change 
clench to hope
