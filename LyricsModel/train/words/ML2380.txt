live a long time ago 
she be stricken with a seizure 
at the age of twenty two 
they take she body in a coffin 
to a tiny church in Liege 
where she spring up from the coffin 
just after the Agnus Dei 
she soar up to the rafter 
perch on a beam up there 
cry the stink of human sin 
be more that I can bear 
Christina the astonishing 
be the most astonishing of all 
she pray balanced on a hurdle 
or curl up into a ball 
she fly to remote place 
climb tower and tree and wall 
to escape the stench of human corruption 
into a oven she do crawl 
of Christina the astonishing 
behave in a terrifying way 
she would run wildly through the street 
jump in the Meusse and swim away 
of Christina the astonishing 
behave in terrifying manner 
die at the age of seventy four 
in the convent of St Anna
