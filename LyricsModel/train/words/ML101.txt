only love can make it rain 
the way the beach be kiss by the sea 
only love can make it rain 
like the sweat of lover lay in the field 
love reign o'er I 
rain of 'er I 
love reign o'er I 
rain of 'er I 
rain of 'er I 
only love can bring the rain 
that make you yearn to the sky 
only love can bring the rain 
that fall like tear from on high 
love reign o'er I 
rain of 'er I 
love reign o'er I 
rain of 'er I 
rain of 'er I 
on the dry and dusty road 
the night we spend apart alone 
I need to get back home to cool cool rain 
I can not sleep and I lay and I think 
the night be hot and black as ink 
oh God I need a drink of cool cool rain 
love reign o'er I 
rain o'er I of 'er I of 'er I 
love reign o'er I 
rain of 'er I 
rain of 'er I 
love
