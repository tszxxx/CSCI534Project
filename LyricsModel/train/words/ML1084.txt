and I be not the kind that like to tell you 
just what I want to do 
I be not the kind that need to tell you 
just what you want I to

I understand every word that be say 
and now that I have actually hear it

and I be not the kind that like to tell you 
just what you want I to 
you be not the kind that need to tell I 
about the bird and the bee 
do you find this happen all the time 
crucial point one day become a crime 
and I be not the kind that like to tell you 
just what I want to do
