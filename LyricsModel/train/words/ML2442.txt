this be where you sanity give in 
and love begin 
never lose you grip 
do not trip do not fall 
you will lose it all 
the sweetest way to die 
it lie deep inside 
you can not hide 
it be the meanest fire 
oh it be a strange desire 
you can not lie 
that be a needless fight 
this be where you sanity give in 
and love begin 
never lose you grip 
do not trip do not fall 
you will lose it all 
the sweetest way to die 
when you blood run dry 
you be paralyzed 
it will eat you mind 
do you hold it back 
it come to you in slow attack 
it be the meanest fire 
this be where you sanity give in 
and love begin 
never lose you grip 
do not trip do not fall 
you will lose it all 
this be where you sanity give in 
and love begin 
never lose you grip 
do not trip do not fall 
you will lose it all 
this be where you sanity give in 
and love begin 
never lose you grip 
do not trip do not fall 
you will lose it all 
the sweetest way to die
