[Verse 1]
Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
[Verse 2]
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
[Bridge 1]
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright
[Chorus]
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
[Bridge 2]
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
[Verse 3]
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so
[Chorus]
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's going to take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
