crawling 
over you window you think I be confused 
I be wait for the divergent wasp 
to complete my current ruse 
you use a plate glass screen 
to protect my choose target 
but there be a air pellet hole 
I can crawl through to you 
I be the fly in the ointment 
I can spread more disease than the flea 
which nibble away at you window display 
yes I be the fly in the ointment 
I shake you down to say please 
as you accept the next dose of disease 
I be the fly I be the fly 
I be the fly I be the fly 
fly in the fly in the ointment 
I be the fly I be the fly 
I be the fly I be the fly 
fly in the fly in the ointment 
I be the fly I be the fly 
I be the fly I be the fly 
fly in the fly in the ointment 
yes I be the fly I be the fly 
I be the fly I be the fly 
fly in the fly in the ointment 
I be the fly I be the fly 
I be the fly I be the fly 
fly in the fly in the ointment 
yes I be the fly I be the fly
