[Verse 1]
He's a large and ugly giant monster, headless on my back
This urgent haste in my head
Materialized in this dark whole world
No one can help me there
I know this pain has gone too far
The fear is now so loud
Kill a child I'm trying to protect myself
Against your old controlled hate
Pollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light
At least mine were never allowed
[Chorus]
The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light
[Verse 2]
I wanted to hate, I wanted to die
I wanted to see you sacrifice
I had to deal with the fear you gave me
But you fucker never tried to help me
I was jealous and I was scared
Nobody ever replaced my pain
To say I'm not evil, to tell I'm not bad
Too late, I'm lost in human nature
[Pre-Hook]x2
Leave me be
Set me free
Leave me be
Set me free
[Chorus]
The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light
[Bridge]
Unexpected yet expected, emerged from the dark I come to life
Take everything if you give my horse it's head
You know me, you fear me
Always me knocking at your door, always around
Insulted, disrespected, return to the dark into this life
You know me, you fear me x4
You know me, you fear me
[Chorus]
The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light
