shriek the lip across a ragged tongue 
convulse two agether sing violently 
move the jaw cry aloud 
bound up the dead triumphantly 
rag they come and the ragged they kill 
you pray so hard on bloody knee 
rag they come and the ragged they kill 
down in the cool air I can see 
hey yeah I be the one that you want 
hey yeah I be the superbeast 
hey yeah I be the one that you want 
hey yeah I be the superbeast 
stir the limb across the wrist 
full possession of a memory 
bury I oh as a dog 
icy hand surround I 
rag they come and the ragged they kill 
you pray so hard on bloody knee 
rag they come and the ragged they kill 
down in the cool air I can see 
hey yeah I be the one that you want 
hey yeah I be the superbeast 
hey yeah I be the one that you want 
hey yeah I be the superbeast 
shriek the lip across a ragged tongue 
convulse two agether sing violently 
move the jaw cry aloud 
bound up the dead triumphantly 
rag they come and the ragged they kill 
you pray so hard on bloody knee 
rag they come and the ragged they kill 
down in the cool air I can see 
hey yeah I be the one that you want 
hey yeah I be the superbeast 
hey yeah I be the one that you want 
hey yeah I be the superbeast
