talk about steal the show 
no one would know 
talk about steal the show 
when they be all let go 
take a look at the witch 
see the twitch in she eye 
tell I what do she feel 
be this the weight of the world 
take a boy and a girl 
and show they lie be real 
and then I see the edge I look I fall 
and I get deeper and deeper 
the more I see the more I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I get deeper and deeper 
be it the smell of the oil 
or the sweat and the toil 
that make live unreal 
be it the man in the suit 
or the one with a flute 
tell I what do he steal 
be it begin to break 
can you see the mistake 
they will be nowhere to go 
be it a fool 's blood 
in the wrong neighborhood 
what price do he pay 
and then I see the edge I look I fall 
I get deeper and deeper 
the more I see the more I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I get deeper and deeper 
to make you see what I mean 
tell I what do I say 
hire you voice for freedom of choice 
what do you say 
so I be talk about steal the show 
no one would know 
oh I be talk about steal the show 
when they be all let go 
and then I see the edge I look I fall 
and I get deeper and deeper 
the more I see the more I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I get deeper and deeper 
and then I see the edge I look I fall 
and I get deeper and deeper 
the more I see the more I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I get deeper and deeper 
oh oh I see the edge I look I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I see the edge I look I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I see the edge I look I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call 
I see the edge I look I fall 
no place to hide you better take the call
