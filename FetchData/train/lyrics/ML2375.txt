Fuck you and this whole city and everyone in it
Carved name into my skin in candlelight
Sew it up with hate
Carve a message in my arm in candlelight
Sew it up with hate
Found my misery with a match and gasoline
Burned alive, I am a killing machine, whole life I'm silent
Found my destiny with a match and gasoline
Liars burn and scream a whole life indebted to you
The silence of pain, insane I feel love, sick not to hurt
I wanna watch the world burn
Found my misery with a match and gasoline
Burned alive, I am a killing machine, whole life I'm silent
Found my destiny with a match and gasoline
Come back, can you hear me scream?
Whole life indebted to you
The silence of pain, insane I feel love, sick not to hurt
I wanna watch the world burn
The silence of pain, insane I feel love, sick not to hurt
I wanna watch the world burn
Carved name into my skin in candlelight
Sew it up with hate
The silence of pain, insane I feel love, sick not to hurt
I wanna watch the world burn
The silence of pain, insane I feel love, sick not to hurt
I wanna watch the world burn
Down, down
