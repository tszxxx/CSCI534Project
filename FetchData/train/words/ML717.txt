when whippoorwill call and evening be nigh I hurry to my blue heaven just a turn to the right , you will find a little white light will lead you to my Blue Heaven you will see a smile face , a fireplace , a cozy little room a little nest that nestle where the rose bloom just Marley and I , and baby make three we be happy in my blue heaven you will see a smile face , a fireplace , a cozy little room a little nest that nestle where the rose bloom just Marley and I , and baby make three we be happy in my blue heaven so happy in my blue heaven
