Way across town a phone ring off the wall 
if you know he be not home why do you keep call 
you be go to drive yourself crazy and you know that it be true 
it be just make you wild and blue 
wild and blue 
it be no wonder 
look at the thing you do 
they could just take you up yonder honey 
you be already wild and blue 
in somebody 's room on the far side of town 
with you mind all make up 
and the shade all pull down 
someone be try to satisfy you 
he do not know that you be wild and you be blue 
wild and blue 
it be no wonder 
look at the thing you do 
they could just take you up yonder honey 
you be already wild and blue 
it be four in the morning 
and you be all alone 
with no place to go 
why do not you come home 
I will be right here baby wait for you 
I know you have be wild and blue 
wild and blue 
it be no wonder 
look at the thing you do 
they could just take you up yonder honey 
you be already wild and blue 
wild and blue 
it be no wonder 
look at the thing you do 
they could just take you up yonder honey 
you be already wild and blue
