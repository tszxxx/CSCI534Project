one little Christmas tree be stand alone 
wait for someone to come by 
one little Christmas tree that never have grow 
cry as he look up to the sky 
oh please Mr. Father tree the tallest of all 
I be so afraid and so alone 
could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small 
light up someone 's home cause 
one little Christmas tree can light up a home 
so one little child can find a toy 
one little Christmas tree can light up a home 
so one little heart can find some joy 
one little angel who be ride a star 
cry as she look down at the tree 
oh please Mr. Father tree wherever you be 
may I give he the star you give to I 
then in the heaven come a voice from afar 
a voice that be hear throughout the world 
go down little angel girl and give he you star 
tonight he will light the world cause 
one little Christmas tree can light up the world 
so those who be lose may find they way 
one little Christmas tree can light up the world 
so all man may see on Christmas day 
one little Christmas tree can light up the world 
so those who be lose may find they way 
one little Christmas tree can light up the world 
so all man may see on Christmas day 
one little Christmas tree can light up the world 
so those who be lose may find they way
