have not the word 
and hand be tie 
they be leave you 
the cheap confusion pull through 
enter the mirror 
the gray appear 
discard the real 
she be make I seem unkind 
listen too long 
so play along 
one seldom view 
policing I be tell jut out 
shoot the breeze 
and see she now 
confide in you 
true image find and cut 
something angle in the dirt 
you do not walk for a hour 
first offensive have be shoot 
lose you footing 
hopeless now 
cover metal on the wall 
you can lend another skin 
twice now fix on such a mess 
subtle green and send it back 
precious ornament to crack 
it be a overwhelming lie 
first offensive have be shoot 
lose you footing 
hopeless now 
cover metal on the wall 
you can lend another skin 
twice now fix on such a mess 
subtle green and send it back 
precious ornament to crack 
it be a overwhelming lie
