come let 's stroll 
stroll across the floor 
come let 's stroll 
stroll across the floor 
now turn around baby 
let 's stroll once more 
feel so good 
take I by my hand 
I feel so good 
take I by my hand 
and let 's go strol 
in wonderland 
Strollin oh yeah 
Strollin rollin' strollin 
well rock my soul 
how I love to stroll 
there be my love 
Strollin in the door 
there be my love 
Strollin in the door 
baby let 's go strollin 
by the candy store
