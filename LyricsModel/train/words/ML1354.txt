as we stroll along together 
holding hand walk all alone 
so in love be we two that we do not know what to do 
so in love in a world all we own 
as we stroll by the sea together 
under star twinkle high above 
so in love be we two no one else but I and you 
so in love so much in love 
so in love so much in love 
we stroll along together 
I tell you I need you oh so much 
I love love you my darling 
can you tell it in my touch 
when we walk down the aisle together 
we will vow to be together till we die 
so much love have we two just can not wait to say I do 
so in love be you and I 
so in love be you and I 
so in love be you and I
