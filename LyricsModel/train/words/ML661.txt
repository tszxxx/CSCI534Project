when we go for a little walk 
out on the land 
when we be just walk and hold hand 
you can take it as a sign of love 
when the wind of fate 
keep blow and we both understand 
sign of love 
it be a sign of love 
sign of love 
when we both have silver hair 
and a little less time 
but there still be rose on the vine 
you can take it as a sign of love 
when I look at you 
when I be look at you for a long long time 
when I first see you 
you be just a girl 
and I be a man 
while the music play 
I watch you dance
