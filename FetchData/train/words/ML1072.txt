on a starry night , down in Virginia I fall in love with a blue eye girl she kiss be warm , she touch be tender the sweetest one in all the world Chorus at night I dream about she in my dream , she hold I tight and when the cloud roll in at twilight I sit and dream of a starry night Second Verse then one day down in Virginia my blue eye girl she go away I miss she love , I miss she kiss I will always mourn that cloudy day Chorus third Verse now if you be goooin' to Virginia do not be fool by a blue eye girl a starry night could leave ya dreamin ' of the sweetest one in all the world
