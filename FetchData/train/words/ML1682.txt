I will be home for Christmas you can count on I please have snow and mistletoe and present under the tree Christmas eve will find I where the love light gleam I will be home for Christmas if only in my dream I will be home , I will be home if only in my dream I will be home , I will be home if only in my dream I be dream tonight of a place I love even more than I usually do and although I know it 's a long road back I promise you I will be home for Christmas you can count on I please have snow and mistletoe and present under the tree Christmas eve will find I where the love light gleam I will be home for Christmas if only in my dream I will be home , I will be home if only in my dream
