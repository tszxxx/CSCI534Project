I be nothing without pretend 
I know my thought 
can not live with they 
I be nothing without a man 
I know my fault 
but I can not hide they 
I still keep my baby tooth 
in a bedside table with my jewelry 
you still sleep in the bed with I 
my jewelry and my baby tooth 
I do not need another friend 
when most of they I can barely keep up with 
I be 
p 
erfectly able to hold my own hand 
but I still can not kiss my own neck 
I want to give you everything 
but I still stand in awe of superficial thing 
I want to love you like my mother 's mother 's mother do 
civilian 
civilian
