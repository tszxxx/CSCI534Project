[Verse 1]
It's not what you thought
When you first began it
You got what you want
Now you can hardly stand it, though
By now you know
[Refrain]
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
'Til you wise up
[Verse 2]
You're sure there's a cure
And you have finally found it
You think one drink
Will shrink you till you're underground
And living down
[Refrain]
But it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
'Til you wise up
[Bridge]
Prepare a list for what you need
Before you sign away the deed
[Refrain]
'Cause it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up
[Outro]
No, it's not going to stop
Till you wise up
No, it's not going to stop
So just give up
