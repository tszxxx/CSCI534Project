I be high tonight lookin for some fun 
rage metal with spike and chain 
Chorus 
I be a skull splitter 
till the brink of daw and 
drank too many 
thousand on the lawn 
I be a skull splitter 
thrashing till the end 
kickin ass cause it feel great 
up at dawn the rise dead 
we be conquer in Balingen 
rage metal with spike 
and chain 
and all the woman 
I be a skull splitter 
I be a skull splitter 
I be a skull splitter
