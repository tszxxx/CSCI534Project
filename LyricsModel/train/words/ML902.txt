you be no angel I be no saint if we be 
we would not be in this place tonight 
lose and lonely scared and confused 
we both have a past nothing to lose tonight 
well it cut like a knife these bad luck blue 
we both get scar from the hell we be throw 
somebody 's get win somebody be get to lose 
so let 's roll the dice one more time 
take a chance on love again tonight 
Risk it all lay it on the line 
let the skeleton fight for life 
tonight hold on tight as we collide 
reconnect feel no pain 
seek shelter like a spark in the rain tonight 
wear and weather scared to go home 
we be here together but still all alone tonight 
and there be no need to lie we have both be abuse 
the love and the pain the cocaine and booze now 
most people do not but some people do
