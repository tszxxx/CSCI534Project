so we all be grow old and it be get old 
pressure on we hollow bone and the varicose 
suddenly we decompose but we be not alone 
so we all be grow old 
maybe we be seal in silence 
and maybe we feel a guidance 
maybe you own device 
will keep you afraid and cold but I 
memorize you smile line when lip divide 
keep alive you childlike reaction time 
we be allow to expire with ourselves in mind 
so we all be grow old 
put out the fear of silence 
and put out the need for guidance 
and put out you own device 
and do not be afraid of the cold and 
we sing we sing we sing 
we fight we fight we fight 
and then we cry we cry we cry 
then we slide we slide we slide into the light 
do we sing we fight we cry 
we slide we slide we slide into the light 
maybe we be seal in silence 
maybe we feel a guidance 
maybe you own device 
will keep you afraid and cold well 
put out the fear of silence 
put out the need for guidance 
put out you own device 
do not be afraid of the cold 
afraid of the cold afraid over time 
you have get nowhere to go but here
