[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
No more!
The crap rolls out of your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about your self instead?
Who are you? Where you been? Where you from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much, you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
Yeah! Who the hell are you?!?
[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]
[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
[Outro: James Hetfield]
NOT!!
