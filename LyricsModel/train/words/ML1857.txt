what be you cry for 
what be you desire 
how can I help a poor soul 
swallow the solution I offer you 
exhale and you lose all you fear 
just give it a try 
you want to 
so I do what you ask I to do 
it be never too late for a twist of fate 
believe and elate you mind 
and try to segregate the feeling you hate 
on my watch you will be able to fly 
do not you feel better now 
rely onto I 
my cure be a lifetime deal 
love I and hate I 
fear I and take I 
die a thousand time 
I just want to be another I 
cause I can not stand the uncertainty 
why can not I just see another side of myself 
just give it a try 
you want to 
so I do what you ask I to do 
it be never too late for a twist of fate 
believe and elate you mind 
and try to segregate the feeling you hate 
on my watch you will be able to fly
