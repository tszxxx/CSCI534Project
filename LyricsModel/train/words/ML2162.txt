now be not the time to be so sad and mournful 
we be go to the funeral and we will be dance the night away 
so so so do not be so shy we be live and we be die 
we be laugh and we be cry every single day 
strange but not surprisin nor be it unfamiliar 
how it take a death like this to bring we together 
you know you will always be my flesh and blood 
I could never do you wrong 
and the one who be go for so long be come home 
alright 
now be not the time to be so sad and mournful 
we be go to the funeral and we will be dance the night away 
so so so do not be so shy we be live and we be die 
we be laugh and we be cry every single day 
we be get older at the blink of a eye 
so do not let the moment pass you by 
I do not believe there be a greater love one of patience and pain 
than the love between a mama and she child 
in the procession down to the lighthouse 
we hear the crashing of the wafe and the mistake we make 
you know that we be not the only one so we can have some fun 
have some have some have some have some fun 
now be not the time to be so sad and mournful 
we be go to the funeral and we will be dance the night away 
so so so do not be so shy we be live and we be die 
we be laugh and we be cry every single day 
every single day 
not the time to be so to be so sad 
we be go to the funeral and we will be dance the night away 
so so so do not be so shy we be live and we be die 
we be laugh and we be cry every single day 
every single day
