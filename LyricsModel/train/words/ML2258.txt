I be disappointed every morning that I wake up 
I be disappointed by the feeling of wake up next to you 
you call I up and let I know that 
that my sick guilt be so unwelcome 
it be so unwelcome yeah 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness in you voice 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness inside you 
my health be fail I so I flip on the television 
and watch sad movie and look for sad sick people like I 
call I up and let I know that 
that my sick guilt be so unwelcome 
I be so unwelcome I be so unwelcome 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness in you voice 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness inside you 
we could go we could go through the front door 
we could go we go in through the front door 
we could go we go in through the front door 
we could go I come in through the front door 
through the front door 
and the pill they will not will not will not will not let I go 
and I will not will not will not let you drink yourself alone 
you call I up and let I know that 
that my sick guilt be so unwelcome 
you be so unwelcome you be so unwelcome 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness in you voice 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness inside you 
I hear noise in the darkness 
I hear sadness inside you
