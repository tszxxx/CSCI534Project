with one light on in one room 
I know you be up when I get home 
with one small step upon the stair 
I know you look when I get there 
if you be a king up there on you throne 
would you be wise enough to let I go 
for this queen you think you own 
want to be a hunter again 
I want to see the world alone again 
to take a chance on life again 
so let I go 
the unread book and painful look 
the tv 's on the sound be down 
one long pause then you begin 
oh look what the cat be bring in 
if you be a king up there on you throne 
would you be wise enough to let I go 
for this queen you think you own 
want to be a hunter again 
I want to see the world alone again 
to take a chance on life again 
so let I go let I leave 
for the crown you have place upon my head feel too heavy now 
and I do not know what to say to you but I will smile anyhow 
and all the time I be think think 
I want to be a hunter again 
I want to see the world alone again 
to take a chance on life again 
so let I go 
I want to be a hunter again 
I want to see the world alone again 
to take a chance on life again 
so let I go let I leave 
let I go
