if we lip should meet Innamorata 
kiss I kiss I sweet Innamorata 
hold I close and say you be mine 
with a love as warm as wine 
I be at heaven 's door Innamorata 
want you more and more Innamorata 
you be a symphony a very beautiful sonata my Innamorata 
say that you be my sweetheart my love 
you be a symphony a very beautiful sonata my Innamorata 
say that you be my sweetheart my one and only sweetheart 
say that you be my sweetheart my love
