I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do
You know what, you're lovely
You know what, you're so lovely
And, oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
'specially when you do 
the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For Heaven rest us, Im not asbestos
And that's why
I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So If I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they want to do
You know what, you're lovely
Ring-a-ding-ding, you're lovely
And oh what, you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
'specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For Heaven rest us, Im not asbestos
And that's why
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So If I hold you in my arms....
I won't dance
