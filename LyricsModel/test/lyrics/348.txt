Gee, but it's great after being out late
Walkin' my baby back home
Arm and arm over meadow and farm
Walkin' my baby back home
We go along harmonizing a song
Or I'm reciting a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home
We stop for awhile she gives me a smile
Snuggles her head to my chest
We started to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest
After I kind of straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home
La, la, la, dee, la, la, la, dee
Know she's afraid of the dark
So I have to park
Right outside the door 'til it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
So I dry her tears off all through the night
La, la, la, dee, la, la, la, dee
We stop for awhile she gives me a smile
Snuggles her head to my chest
We started to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest
After I kind of straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home
Walkin' my baby back home
