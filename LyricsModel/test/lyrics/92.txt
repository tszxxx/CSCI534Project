[Intro: Fred Durst &amp; (Jonathan Davis)]
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
(My dick is bigger than yours)
Ooh, say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
(My band is bigger than yours)
[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Too bad, I got your beans in my bag
You stuck-up sucker, Korny motherfucker
Taking over flows is the Limp pimp
Need a Bizkit to save this crew from Jon Davis
I'm gonna drop a little east side skill
Ya best step back cause I'mma kill, I'mma kill
So, what you thinking, Mr. Raggedy man?
Doing all you can to look like Raggedy Ann
[Verse 2: Jonathan Davis]
Check you out, punk, yes I know you feel it
You look like one of those dancers from the Hanson video
You little faggot ho', please give me some shit to work with
Cause right now I'm all it, kid, suck my dick, kid, like your daddy did
[Verse 3: Fred Durst &amp; (Jonathan Davis)]
Who the fuck you think you're talking to? (Me!)
I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you (Whatever)
All up in my face with that "are you ready?"
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady
You little fairy, smelling on your flowers
Nappy hairy chest, look it's Austin Powers (Aw, yeah, baby!)
I hear ya tweeting on them fag-pipes
, clod
But you said it best, there's no place to hide
[Verse 4: Jonathan Davis &amp; (Fred Durst)]
What the fuck ya saying? You're a pimp whatever, Limp dick
Fred Durst needs to rehearse, needs to reverse what he's saying
Wannabe funk joke is what you're playing
Ripping up a bad 
counterfeit
, faking!
Plus your bills, I'm paying
You can't eat that shit every day, Fred, lay off the bacon
(Say what, say what?
You better watch your fucking mouth, Jon)
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis &amp; (Fred Durst)]
So, you hate me!
(And I hate you!)
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family
I hate you!
(And you hate me!)
You know what?
It's all in the family
[Verse 5: Jonathan Davis]
Look at you, fool, I'm gonna fuck you up twice
Throwing rhymes at me like, oh shit, alright, Vanilla Ice
Ya better run, run while ya can, can never fuck me up
Bisc Limpkit, at least I got a P.H.A.T. original band
[Verse 6: Fred Durst &amp; (Jonathan Davis)]
Who's hot, who's not? (You!)
You best step back, 
Korn on the cob
 (Okay)
You need a new job (Ha!)
Time to take them mic skills back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill (Fuck you!)
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack off in your eye
Climbing shoots and ladders
, while your ego shatters
But you just can't get away
Because it's doomsday kid, it's doomsday
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis &amp; (Fred Durst)]
So, I hate you!
(And you hate me!)
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family
I hate you!
(And you hate me!)
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family
[Verse 7: Fred Durst &amp; (Jonathan Davis)]
You call yourself a singer? (Yep!)
You're more like Jerry Springer
 (Oh, cool!)
Your favorite band is Winger
 (Winger?)
And all you eat is Zingers
You're like a Fruity Pebble
Your favorite flag is rebel (Yee-haw!)
It's just too bad that you're a fag
And on a lower level
[Verse 8: Jonathan Davis]
So you're from Jacksonville, kicking it like Buffalo Bill
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck
While your sister's on her knees
Waiting for your little peanut
[Verse 9: Fred Durst &amp; (Jonathan Davis)]
Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (Over here!)
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako
Where your father had your mother, your mother had your brother (Nuh-uh!)
It's just too bad your father's mad, your mother's now your lover
[Verse 10: Jonathan Davis]
Come on hillbilly, can your horse do a fucking wheelie?
You love it down south and boy, you sure do got a purdy mouth
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis &amp; (Fred Durst)]
I hate you!
(And you hate me!)
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family
And I hate you!
(And you hate me!)
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family
[Outro: Jonathan Davis &amp; (Fred Durst)]
And I love you!
(And I want you!)
And I'll suck you!
(And I'll fuck you!)
And I'll butt-fuck you!
(And I'll eat you!)
And I'll lick your little dick, motherfucker!
(Say what, say... what?)
