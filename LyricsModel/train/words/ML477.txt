New York snow this time of year 
there be nothing more beautiful to I 
except for you 
make my way on the town 
and I be see familiar place face 
in my pile of coffee grounds 
the day be better the night be still so lonely 
sometimes I think I be the only cab on the road 
watch my breath rise in the sun 
pull myself in two make one 
helplessly feel for my phone and drive away 
this new rhythm I pursue 
be just my get over you 
tell myself that I need to 
I be still look for a play no one say that it be fair 
to be alone 
the day be better the night be still so lonely 
sometimes I think I be the only cab on the road 
the day be better the night be still so lonely 
sometimes I think I be the only cab on the road
