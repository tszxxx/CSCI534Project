Young boy, you done me bad, I went and did ya wrong
Then I got high, Lord I got high
Now I got a bone to pick with you and I'm sure you know it's true
Oh, one day when you're looking back
You were young and man you were sad
When you're young you get sad
When your young you get sad, then you get high, oh man
Young gal, you done me bad, now I went and did ya wrong
Young gal, you done me bad, so I went and did ya wrong
Then I got high, Lord, I got high
Now you got a bone to pick with me, but I wish you'd let me be
Oh, one day when you're looking back
You were young and man you were sad
When you're young you get sad
When your young you get sad, then you get high, you get high
Oh, the days the rain would fall your way
Oh, the days the rain would fall your way
Then you be high, 'cause you got sad
'Cause you got sad, oh man
Oh man
Oh man
Oh man
