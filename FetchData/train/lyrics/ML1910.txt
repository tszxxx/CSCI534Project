[Verse 1:]
Young and tender
I think you're the girl for me
Not used up
You're still tight
We should hit it off
And she said
You're too fast
It won't last
You can call me
Innocent
You're just what I'm looking for
A girl that's not so fast
She can't slow down
Without too much experience
You fit the bill
'Cause you're so innocent
[Chorus:]
Innocent
Innocent
I'm looking for a girl who's
Innocent, girl
Innocent
Innocent
[Verse 2:]
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love for you
Just say it's alright
And I will give it all to you, oh
Should I go?
Lose control?
Or should I stay innocent?
You don't have to be so cautious
Every time I ask
You turn me down
All I want to do is love you
It can't be all bad
I just want someone who's
[Chorus:]
Innocent
Innocent
Innocent
Looking for a girl who's
Innocent
So, so, so, so
Innocent, oh
Innocent
Baby, baby, baby
Innocent
That's what you are
Innocent
So, so, so, so
Innocent
I want you for my lady
Innocent
Oh girl
Innocent
Baby, you are
Innocent
Innocent
Baby, baby, yeah
Innocent
Innocent
Innocent
Innocent girl for me
For me, girl
Innocent girl
Innocent
Innocent girl
Innocent
Innocent
Oh, yeah
Innocent, yeah
Innocent
Innocent girl
Innocent
That's the kind of girl for me
Innocent
I'm looking for a girl who's
Innocent
You're sure to lose your
Innocent, girl
Oh, girl, why don't you slap me?
Innocent
Innocent
Innocent
