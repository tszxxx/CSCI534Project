hey little girl be you daddy home 
do he go away and leave you all alone 
I get a bad desire 
oh oh oh 
I be on fire 
tell I now baby be he good to you 
and can he do to you the thing that I do 
oh no I can take you higher 
oh oh oh 
I be on fire 
sometimes it be like someone take a knife baby edgy and dull 
and cut a six inch valley through the middle of my skull 
at night I wake up with the sheet soakin wet 
and a freight train runnin through the middle of my head 
only you can cool my desire 
oh oh oh 
I be on fire 
oh oh oh 
I be on fire 
oh oh oh 
I be on fire 
ooh ooh ooh 
ooh ooh ooh ooh 
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
