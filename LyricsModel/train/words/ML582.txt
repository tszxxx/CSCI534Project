she walk like a angel walk 
she talk like a angel talk 
and she hair have a kind of curl 
to my mind she be my kind of girl 
she be wise like a angel 's wise 
with eye like a angel 's eye 
and a smile like a kind of pearl 
to my mind she be my kind of girl 
a pretty little face 
that face just knock I off my foot 
a pretty little foot 
she be really sweet enough to eat 
she look like a angel look 
she cook like a angel cook 
and my mind be in a kind of whirl 
to my mind she be my kind of girl 
hmmm pretty little face 
that face just knock I off my foot 
pretty little foot 
she be really sweet enough to eat 
she look like a angel look 
and she cook like a angel cook 
and my mind be in a kind of whirl 
to my mind she be my kind of girl 
yes my poor heart be in a whirl 
she be just my kind she be a girl 
and I be glad
