I get a constant busy signal 
when I call you on the phone 
I get a strong uneasy feeling 
you be not sit there alone 
I be have nasty nasty vision 
and baby you be in every one yeah 
and I be so afraid I be go to find you with 
a so call smokin gun 
maybe you want to end it 
you have have you fill of my kind of fun 
but you do not know how to tell I 
and you know that I be not that dumb 
I put 2 and 1 together 
and you know that be not a even sum 
and I know just where to catch you with 
that well know smokin gun 
I be stand here bewildered 
I can not remember just what I have do 
I can hear the siren whine 
my eye blind by the sun 
I know that I should be run 
my heart be beat just like a drum 
now they have knock I down and takin it 
that still hot smokin gun 
yeah yeah still hot smokin gun 
they have take it 
still hot smokin gun 
oh they have take it 
still hot smokin gun 
they knock I down and take it
