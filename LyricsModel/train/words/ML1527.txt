and you know I can not hold on 
cause I can not miss you while you go 
all these year I have cry and you know I have try 
you never live out the way that you like 
and I know you darkness deep inside 
walk away from the hurt that you leave behind 
and let the rain wash away the regret 
I do not need you to help I forget 
if you walk out do not look back 
do not ever be at what we have 
and I be not sorry but I can not forget 
you leave I bitter by the thing you say 
and I know you darkness deep inside 
walk away from the hurt that you leave behind 
and let the rain wash away the regret 
I do not need you to help I forget 
and you know I can not hold on 
cause I can not miss you while you go 
all these year I have cry and you know I have try 
you never live out the way that you like 
and I know you darkness deep inside 
walk away from the hurt that you leave behind 
and let the rain wash away the regret 
I do not need you to help I forget 
if you walk out do not look back 
do not ever be at what we have 
and I be not sorry but I can not forget 
you leave I bitter by the thing you say 
and I know you darkness deep inside 
walk away from the hurt that you leave behind 
and let the rain wash away the regret 
I do not need you to help I forget
