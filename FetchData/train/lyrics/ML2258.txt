[Verse 1]
I am disappointed every morning that I wake up
I am disappointed by the feeling of waking up next to you
You call me up and let me know that
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome
It's so unwelcome, yeah
[Chorus]
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
[Verse 2]
My health is failing me so I flip on the television
And watch sad movies and look for sad sick people like me
Call me up and let me know that
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome
I'm so unwelcome, I'm so unwelcome
[Chorus]
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
[Bridge]
We could go, we could go through the front door
We could go, we go in through the front door
We could go, we go in through the front door
We could go, I come in through the front door
Through the front door
[Verse 3]
And the pills they will not, will not, will not, will not let me go
And I will not, will not, will not let you drink yourself alone
You call me up and let me know that
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome
You're so unwelcome, you're so unwelcome
[Chorus]
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
I hear sadness inside you
