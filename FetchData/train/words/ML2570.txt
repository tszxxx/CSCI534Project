I remember long ago how I wonder where I would go while the blizzards Cold wind and snow pound outside my window California sunset go down in the West all the color in the sky kiss another day goodbye land of beauty Space and light land of promise land of might you be my home now and it 's true California , here 's to you California sunset go down in the West all the color in the sky kiss another day goodbye California sunset go down in the West all the color in the sky kiss another day goodbye the golden state !
