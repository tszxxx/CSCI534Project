[Chorus: Blind Willie Johnson &amp; Willie B. Harris]
Well... You're gonna need somebody on your bond
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
Lord, Just wait till the midnight when death comes slippin' in your room
You're gonna need, ah, somebody on your bond
[Verse 1: Blind Willie Johnson]
I heard the voice of Jesus saying, He told me He had risen
Now in the waning midnight hour, I don't hold my breath
[Chorus: Blind Willie Johnson &amp; Willie B. Harris]
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
Lord, Just wait till the midnight when death comes slippin' in your room
You're gonna need, ah, somebody on your bond
[Verse 2: Blind Willie Johnson]
When you was a gambler, nobody would go your bond
Fell on your knees and began to pray, 'cause Jesus would go your bond
[Chorus: Blind Willie Johnson &amp; Willie B. Harris]
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
Lord, Just wait till the midnight when death comes slippin' in your room
You're gonna need, ah, somebody on your bond
[Verse 3: Blind Willie Johnson]
I came the day that sad was wearied, wounded, sad
Bounds that held me left this place He has made me glad
[Chorus: Blind Willie Johnson &amp; Willie B. Harris]
I'm gonna need somebody on my bond
Lord, I've got somebody on my bond
Lord, just wait till the midnight when death comes slippin' in your room
I've got somebody on my bond
