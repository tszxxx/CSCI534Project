[Verse 1]
Like a comet
Blazing across the evening sky
Gone too soon
[Verse 2]
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon
[Verse 3]
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night
[Verse 4]
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
[Verse 5]
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
[Verse 6]
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon
[Verse 7]
Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night
[Verse 8]
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
[Outro]
Gone too soon
