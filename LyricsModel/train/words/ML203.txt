I guess you wonder where I have be 
I search to find a love within 
I come back to let you know 
get a thing for you and I can not let go 
my friend wonder what be wrong with I 
well I be in a daze from you love you see 
I come back to let you know 
get a thing for you and I can not let go 
some people go around the world for love 
but they may never find what they dream of 
what you will not do do for love 
you have try everything but you do not give up 
in my world only you 
make I do for love what I would not do 
my friend wonder what be wrong with I 
well I be in a daze from you love you see 
I come back to let you know 
get a thing for you and I can not let go 
and though I only want the best it be true 
I can not believe the thing I do for you 
what you will not do do for love 
you have try everything but you will not give up 
in my world only you make I do for love what I would not do 
make I do for love what I would not do 
make I do for love what I would not do 
make I do for love what I would not do
