there be a prophet on a mountain and he be make up dinner 
with long division and a riding crop 
anybody can feel like a winner when it be serve up piping hot 
but the people be not look for a handout 
they be America 's work corps 
can this be what they vote for 
let they eat war let they eat war 
that be how to ration the poor 
let they eat war let they eat war 
there be a urgent need to feed decline pride 
from the force to the union shop 
the war economy be make new job 
but the people who benefit most 
be break bread with they benevolent host 
who never steal from the rich to give to the poor 
all they ever give to they be a war 
and a foreign enemy to deplore 
let they eat war let they eat war 
that be how to ration the poor 
let they eat war let they eat war 
there be a urgent need to feed decline pride 
we have get to kill them and eat them before they reach for they check 
squeeze some blue collar let they bleed from they neck 
seize a few dollar from the people who sweat 
cause it be freedom or debt and they will not question it 
at a job site the boss be godlike 
condition workhorse park at a stoplight 
seasoned vet with they foot in net 
a stone throw away from a rock fight but not tonight 
here come another ration 
cause they be the finest in the nation 
when there be nothing leave to feed they with 
when it be freedom or it be death 
let they eat war let they eat war 
that be how to ration the poor 
let they eat war let they eat war 
there be a urgent need to feed decline pride
