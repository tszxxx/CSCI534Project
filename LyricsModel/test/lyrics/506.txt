I'm in jail in a Texas town
In my sister's wedding gown
I drive a truck all night long
Listening to Judy Garland songs
Now I'm locked behind bars of steel
I was just looking for a happy meal
I park my rig and I went inside
They've never seen such a pretty bride
Jesse Jane, are you insane?
Or are you just a normal guy
Who dresses like a butterfly
Jesse Jane
I paid my bill and I turned around
Facing every red neck in that one horse town
His face was red. His fist was clenched
He threw his coke and he got me drenched
Jesse Jane, are you insane?
Or are you just an average Joe
Looking for a fashion show
Jesse Jane
Well, I guess that was the final straw
I pulled a pistol from my Wonderbra
I killed him dead. I killed 'em all
And they finally caugh me in the bathroom stall
And now I'm doing ten to life
But I'll tell you one thing, Bubba
Someday I'm gonna make someone in here
A hell of a wife
Jesse Jane, are you insane?
Or are you just a average guy
Who dresses like a butterfly
Jesse Jane
Jesse Jane, are you insane?
Or are you just a Peter Pan
Looking for his Neverland
Jesse Jane
