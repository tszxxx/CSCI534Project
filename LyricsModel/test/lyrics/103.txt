[Intro]
This is a warning
My final warning
GO!
This is a warning
My final warning
[Verse 1]
I got a head full of wreckage
And a mouth full of lies
My mind's in the gutter
I feel like I wanna die
I'm the king of nothing
With a broken crown
I've been taking a beating
But I won't back down
[Chorus]
Free me from myself
Shut down my mind
A solo revolution
Into the light
[Verse 2]
This fear is a weakness
And it's wearing me out
I burn in the sickness
It feels like im going down
I deny my affliction
And I run from the light
It's a lonely condition
But you are the one tonight
[Chorus]
Free me from myself
Shut down my mind
A solo revolution
Into the light
Fuck all this madness and put it aside
Out of the shadows, into the light
Free me from myself
Shut
 down my mind
YEAH!
[Bridge]
Out of the shadows and into the light
Out of the shadows and into the light
[Chorus]
So free me from myself
Shut down my mind
A solo revolution
Into the light
Fuck all this madness, put it aside
Out of the shadows, into the light
Free me from myself
Shot down my mind
Shot down my mind
Free my from myself
