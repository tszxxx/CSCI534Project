a day in the life of a fool a sad and a long lonely day I walk the avenue hope to run into the very sight of you come my way I stop just in front of we door but you be never there any more so back to my room and here in the gloom I cry tear of goodbye Til you come back to I that 's the way it will be everyday in the life of a fool
