Way down in Bowlin' Green
Prettiest girls I've ever seen
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky
To lie down in Bowlin' Green
Bowlin' Green folks treat you kind
They let you think your own mind
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky
In Bowlin' Green you walk your own line
Oh, Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold
It warms the body, I know it touches the soul
Bluegrass is fine, Kentucky owns my mind
The fields down in Bowlin' Green
Have the softest grass I've ever seen
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky
To lie down in Bowlin' Green, yeah
Bowlin' Green girls treat you right
They wear dresses cut country tight
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky
If he's seen a Bowlin' Green night
Oh, Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold
It warms the body, I know it touches the soul
Bluegrass is fine, Kentucky owns my mind
Bowlin' Green
Ah, Bowlin' Green
Bowlin' Green
Ah, Bowlin' Green
Way down in Bowlin' Green
Yeah
