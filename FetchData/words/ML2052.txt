have a dream about you baby , have a dream about I and you have a dream and wake up cry well I can roll but I just can not rock and the time 's go by , tick - tock for the heart , I just can not love no - one but you well I be high and dry and lonely , I be as lonely as can be and I stare out of my window well I can play but I just can not win and the weather 's look dim for the heart I just can not love no - one but you for the heart for the heart for the heart I just can not love no - one but you for the heart for the heart for the heart I just can not love no - one but you for the heart for the heart for the heart I just can not love no - one but you for the heart for the heart for the heart I just can not love no - one but you well , for the heart for the heart for the heart I just can not love no - one but you yes , for the heart for the heart for the heart I just can not love no - one but you
