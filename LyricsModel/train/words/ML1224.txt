envision World War two 
in a land that be rule by hate and hunger 
I guide the fade soul 
as body drow in flame 
all the world be a cemetery 
a new order be disperse 
like a brutal catharsis 
this be the dawning of the 
Warcurse 
echoe death 's eternal call 
hatred be forever 
Warcurse 
peace forever be disturb 
violence be conquer the world 
dream to erase 
the one that they forever despise 
perverse ideology 
from the lowest son of the soil 
I be watch ever- present 
suffer from every race 
take a look into the mirror 
and you will see my face 
Warcurse 
echoe death 's eternal call 
hatred be forever 
Warcurse 
peace forever be disturb 
violence be conquer the world 
air raid shelter as the siren scream 
word to ease all mortal fear 
lift the soul off on the german front 
count cadaver on the lose 
soldier of hate Nazi leader and civilian 
I will take they to where they belong 
for I have see many war 
Heard a hundred call to arm 
salvation be my name alarm 
pure hate be in the air that I breath 
pure hate 
a sickness that be know as pure hate 
abnormal cruelty bring no victory to this war 
pure hate the wise see it come 
pure hate the mighty pave the path 
pure hate 
my kiss of death come as a blessing not a curse 
the curse live on and on and on and on 
and on and on and on and on and on 
and on and on and on 
Gggggrhhhh eternal 
Warcurse 
Warcurse 
Warcurse 
Warcurse 
violence be conquer the world
