down in Santa Rosa and over the bay 
across the grapevine to LA 
we have get desert we have get tree 
we have get the hill of Beverly 
let 's burn the hill of Beverly 
walk with you credit card in the air 
swingin nunchakus 
like you just do not care 
this be the slow sick suck part of I 
this be the slow sick suck part of I 
and when I suck in kiss it be ours 
up to the top of the Shasta Gulch 
to the bottom of the Tahoe Lake 
man make delta 
and 
concrete river 
the south take what the north deliver 
you film hack I do not use you fade 
lose in the foothill of my pride 
Trocadero say goodnight 
to the last psychadelic band 
from 
Sacto Northern Cal 
from Sacto Northern Cal 
take it neighbor cause you be my neighbor 
and I need favor you be my neighbor 
you have do I favor cause I be you neighbor 
I be not you neighbor you Bakersfield trash
