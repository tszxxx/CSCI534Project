[Intro]
(one, two
One, two, three, four)
[Chorus 1]
I, I love, love
And I, and I love you
Oh you, you, yeah you
And you, you, love, love
And you, yes you, you love me
Yeah you, you, yeah you
[Chorus 2]
And when I'm holding you
What a feeling
Seems so good to be true
That I'm telling you all
That I must be dreaming
[Chorus 1]
And I, and I love you
Oh you, you, yeah you
[Chorus 2]
And when I'm holding you
What a feeling
Seems so good to be true
That I'm telling you all
That I must be dreaming
[Chorus 1]
I, I love, love
And I, and I love you
Oh you, you, yeah you
[Outro]
Oh, you know that I love you, oh oh oh
Oh, you know that I love you, I love you, I, I said I love you
