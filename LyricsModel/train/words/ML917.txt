Blue sky look at I 
nothing but blue sky do I see 
bluebird sing a song 
nothing but bluebird from now on 
I never see the sun shine so bright 
never see thing goin so right 
notice the day hurry by 
when you be in love my my how they fly 
Blue day all of they go 
nothing but blue sky from now on 
look at I 
Blue sky look at I 
nothing but blue sky do I see 
bluebird sing a song 
nothing but bluebird from now on 
I never see the sun shine so bright 
never see thing goin so right 
notice the day hurry by 
when you be in love my my how they fly 
Blue day all of they go 
nothing but blue sky 
nothing but blue sky 
Blue sky blue blue sky 
nothing but blue sky from now on
