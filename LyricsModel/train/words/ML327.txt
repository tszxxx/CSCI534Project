I feel the sun it be return again 
to chase the cold far away 
I be not alone to fight the world I m in 
you give I hope for better day 
I be search for a friend like no other 
I never think you d come my way 
everything I give to you 
I hill love you so 
everything I say or do 
I hill love you so 
look where we have come how could I ever forget 
before you love my heart be dead 
I be afraid that my sun would set 
but you stay around to lift my head 
I be live my whole life undercover 
I never dream I have see you face 
everything I give to you 
I hill love you so 
and everything I say or do 
I hill love you so 
ooh I hill love you so 
ooh I hill love you so 
everything I give to you 
I hill let it go 
everything I say or do 
I hill love you so 
ooh I hill love you so 
ooh I hill love you so 
I hill love you so 
I feel the sun
