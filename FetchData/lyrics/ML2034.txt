Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so
Tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Loves pure light
Radiant beams from
Thy holy face
With the dawn of
Redeeming grace
Jesus Lord, at thy birth
Jesus Lord, at thy birth
Silent night
Holy night
Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so
Tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
