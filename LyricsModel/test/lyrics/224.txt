We'll build a dream house so lovely
Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night,
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Living our love in memory
Just you and I, forever and a day,
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way,
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear,
East of the Sun and West of the Moon.
Just you and I, forever and a day,
Love will not die, we will keep it that way,
Way, up among the stars we'll find,
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear,
East of the Sun and West of the Moon.
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear,
East of the Sun and West of the Moon.
Well,
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear,
East of the Sun and West of the Moon.
