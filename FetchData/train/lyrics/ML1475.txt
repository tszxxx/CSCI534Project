[Verse 1]
You, you never call
You never write me or nothing
I set myself up to fall
I was stupid then to try
[Verse 2]
And I'm living a lie
I'm in a fantasy world
But the hero won't win this time
'Cause a pipe dream gets flushed away
[Pre-Chorus]
By all means I'm gettin' mad
But that don't mean I don't feel sorry for ya
[Chorus]
How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me
I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face but I'm already gone
[Verse 1]
You, you never call
You never write me or nothing
I set myself up to fall
I was stupid then to try
[Verse 3]
There was something in the way
Something in the way
Something in the way that you shut the door
I couldn't get enough, when you'd blow me off
I just kept dragging myself back for more
[Pre-Chorus]
By all means I'm gettin' mad
But that don't mean I don't feel sorry for ya
[Chorus]
How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me
I was wrong for coming here
Youâ€™ll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face but I'm already gone
[Bridge]
One day you're gonna see
The life sentence you gave to me
But I swear, one day we will share this cell
I know it's cold but I will keep us warm
With all the hate I radiate
We'll be walking hand in hand in hell
(We'll be walking hand in hand in hell)
[Chorus]
How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me
I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face but I'm already gone
