we walk the loneliest mile 
we smil without any style 
we kiss altogether wrong 
no intention 
we lie about each other 's drink 
we live without each other thinking 
what anyone would do 
without I and you 
it be like I tell you 
only the lonely can play 
so hold on here we go 
hold on to nothing we know 
I feel so lonely 
Way up here 
you mention the time we be together 
so long ago 
well I do not remember 
all I know be that it make I feel good now 
it be like I tell you 
only the lonely can play 
only the lonely 
only the lonely can play 
only the lonely 
only the lonely can play 
it be like I tell you 
only the lonely can play 
only the lonely 
only the lonely can play
