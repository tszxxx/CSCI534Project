cry , my little one , footsore and weary ? fall asleep , pretty one , warm on my shoulder I must tramp on through the winter night dreary while the snow fall on I colder and colder you be my one , and I have not another sleep soft , my darling , my trouble and treasure sleep warm and soft in the arm of you mother dream of pretty thing , dream of pleasure
