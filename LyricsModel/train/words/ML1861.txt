Fire cracker 
you wave in the night 
and something that I see be flame 
you body it be real in the light 
on the fourth of July we be scream 
well I see the lonely road 
you leave and say to I do not follow 
cause I will only bring you sorrow 
and on down my lonely road 
you leave and I just say 
oh no no no no no. 
all I say 
no no no no no. 
well I be back in my old town again 
be there something still alive that I leave here 
you still like the boy on the street 
I will take you uptown just to see you meet they 
and I see the lonely road 
you leave and say to I do not follow 
cause I will only bring you sorrow 
and on down my lonely road 
you leave and I just say 
oh no no no no no. 
all I say 
no no no no no. 
you know I have be read the bible for a change 
maybe there be something I have miss there 
I say I have see well I have see some eye in the rain 
and they creep at my mind and I see you whisper 
well fire cracker you wave in the night 
and something that I see be flame 
do you feel like we leave something here 
something worth come back and claim 
well I see the lonely road 
you leave and say to I do not follow 
cause I will only bring you sorrow 
and on down my lonely road 
you leave and say to I do not follow 
you sleep and dream for tomorrow 
down in the dead of night 
you leave and say to I do not follow 
cause I will only bring you sorrow 
and on down my lonely road 
you leave and I just say 
oh no no no no no. 
well I say 
no no no no no
