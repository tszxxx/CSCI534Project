[Intro: Ralph Tresvant]
My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me high up off my feet
She's so fine, as can be
I know this girl is meant for me
[Chorus: Ralph]
Candy girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day
[Verse 1]
[Ralph]
All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through and through
The way you walk, and the way you talk
You always look so good, you make forget my thoughts
[Interlude: Ricky Bell]
(Do you really love me?) Do you really love me?
(Don't you really care?) Don't you really care?
(Do you really need me?) Do you really need me
And will you always be there?
[Ralph]
Every night and every day
I'm always thinking of you in every way
All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through
[Chorus: Ralph, 
Ricky
, 
Bobby Brown

Candy girl
You are my world
You're everything, everything, everything to me
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love, each and every day!

Check out Mike and Bobby's little lady!
(Ooooh-weeeee!)
[Michael Bivins]
Well, check out Ricky and Ralph's!
(Oooooh-weeee!)
[Bobby]
What about Ronnie's!
[Ronnie DeVoe]
She's bad, she's bad, I know she's bad!
[Rap]
[Michael]
She walks so fast, she looks so sweet
She makes my heart just skip a beat
[Bobby]
My girl's the best and that's no lie
She tells me that I'm her only guy!
[Ricky]
That might be true, but my girl's a joy
She don't play around, she's right to the point!
[Ralph]
My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me high up off my feet
Oh, candy
You look so sweet
Oh, candy!
You're a special treat
Candy (You're my candy), candy girl (Candy)
Candy (Girl, you're my candy), candy girl (Candy)

Candy girl
I need it, need it, need it, need it, need it every day
Candy girl...
