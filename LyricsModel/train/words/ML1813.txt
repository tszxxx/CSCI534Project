welcome to the abandon land 
come on in child take my hand 
here there be no work or play 
only one bill to pay 
there be just five word to say 
as you go down down down 
you be go to burn in Hell 
oh burn in Hell 
you can not believe all the thing I have do wrong in my life 
without even try I have live on the edge of a knife 
well I have play with fire I do not want to get myself burn 
to thine own self be true so I think that it be time for a turn 
before I burn in Hell 
oh burn in Hell 
take one good look at you heart tell I what do you see 
it be black and it be dark now be that how you want it to be 
it be up to you what you do will decide you own fate 
make you choice now for tomorrow may be far too late 
and then you will burn in Hell 
oh burn in Hell 
you be go to burn in Hell 
oh burn in hell 
hear no evil do not you see no evil do not you lay no evil down on I 
speak no evil do not you think no evil do not you lay with evil cause I be free 
hear no evil do not you see no evil do not you lay no evil down on I 
speak no evil do not you think no evil do not you lay with evil cause I be free 
oh burn in Hell 
you be go to burn in Hell
