you take the skyway high above the busy little one way 
in my stupid hat and glofe at night I lie awake 
wonderin if I will sleep 
wonderin if we will meet out in the street 
but you take the skyway 
it do not move at all like a subway 
it be get bum when it be cold like any other place it be warm up inside 
sittin down and waitin for a ride beneath the skyway 
oh then one day I see you walkin down that little one way 
where the place I would catch my ride most every day 
there be not a damn thing I could do or say 
up in the skyway 
in skyway 
Skyway
