Meaningless, it's meaningless
It's meaningless, it's meaningless
I take the hold, I take the hold
I take the hold, I take the hold
Mindlessness, it's mindlessness
It's mindlessness, it's mindlessness
I bled for days, I bled for days
I bled for days, I bled for days
Get to the race, the healing of it fucking with
Conceal the scab, you don't want to show
Into the hate, I channel all the negative and
I bled for days now I take the hold, go
Get to the race, the healing of it fucking with
Conceal the scab, you don't want to show
Into the hate I channel all the negative and
I bled for days now I take the hold
I don't believe it, fuck me, read me, get me, bled for days
Smile on my rage I'm scarred by age, I bled for days
Uselessness, it's uselessness
It's uselessness, it's uselessness
Make my weapons, make my weapons
Make my weapons, take the hold
I don't believe it, fuck me, read me, get me, bled for days
Smile on my rage I'm scarred by age, I bled for days
I don't believe it, fuck me, read me, get me, bled for days
Smile on my rage I'm, scarred by age, I bled for days
Bled for days, bled for days
Get to the race, the healing of it fucking with
Conceal the scab you don't want to show
Into the hate I channel all the negative and
I bled for days now I take the hold
Get to the race, the healing of it fucking with
Conceal the scab you don't want to show
Into the hate I channel all the negative and
I bled for days now I take the hold
