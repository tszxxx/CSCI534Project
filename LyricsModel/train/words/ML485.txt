if I see you on the street 
and you say come and follow I 
but I have to give up everything 
all I once hold dear and all of my dream 
would I love you enough to let go 
or would my love run dry 
when you ask for my life 
when do love become unmoving 
when do love become unconsuming 
forget what the world have tell I 
Father of love you can have I 
you can have I 
if you be all you claim to be 
then I be not lose anything 
so I will crawl upon my knee 
just to know the joy of suffering 
I will love you enough to let go 
Lord I give you my life 
I give you my life 
when do love become unmoving 
when do love become unconsuming 
forget what the world have tell I 
Father of love you can have I 
you can have I 
I want to be where you be 
I be run into you arm 
and I will never look back 
so Jesus here be my heart 
when do love become unmoving 
when do love become unconsuming 
forget what the world have tell I 
Father of love you can have I 
when do love become unmoving 
when do love become unconsuming 
forget what the world have tell I 
Father of love you can have I 
you can have I 
my Father my love 
you can have I
