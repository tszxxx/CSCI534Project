you and I we fly 
you and I we be part of a fall ember 
and I should say goodbye 
but I know it be always now or never 
so step easy in the sun 
it be simple just to try 
you and I we know not what we be make of 
like a callin in the night 
it be goin on and on and till forever 
so step easy in the sun 
the pitfall here be go 
and there be other that will bring you along 
so step easy in the sun 
simple just to try 
you and I we know not what we be make of 
like a callin in the night 
it be goin on and on and till forever 
so step easy in the sun 
the pitfall here be go 
and there be other that will bring you along 
so step easy in the sun 
step easy in the sun 
step easy in the sun
