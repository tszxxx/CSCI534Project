[Pre-Verse: Emily, Theresa, Jenny]
The clit-cut, the clit-cut, the clit-cut, the cut what?
The clit-cut, the clit-cut, the clit-cut, the cut what?
The clit-cut, the clit-cut, the clit-cut, the cut what?
How can I keep my composure with my clit cut?
The clit-cut, the clit-cut, the clit-cut, the cut what?
The clit-cut, the clit-cut, the clit-cut, the cut what?
The clit-cut, the clit-cut, the clit-cut, the cut what?
How can I keep my composure?
[Verse: Emily, Theresa]
How can I keep my composure?
How can I keep my composure?
How can I keep my composure?
I turn my back and you've got my shoulder
Release your mind, through your hands and your feet
A sigh digs you out when you're getting too deep
How can I keep my composure?
How can I keep my composure?
A sordid spot, a monster takeover
Living in shame's gonna haunt your sleep
How can I keep..
How can I keep..
How can I keep my composure?
[Chorus: Emily, Theresa]
Darling why
I am falling
And the words are gone
You are beyond, you are beyond
You are beyond, you are beyond
You are beyond, you are beyond
You are beyond, you are beyond
You are beyond
[Pre-Verse]
[Chorus]
[Outro]
You are beyond
You are beyond
