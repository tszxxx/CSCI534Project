tired of fall backwards 
tired of all the deceit 
I will show no allegiance 
all shall feel my wrath 
ten year of discontent never give a chance 
but love be passion may love be vengeance 
and this love I shall foresake 
and on this day I slit my wrist 
and do away with everything fuck it 
cut up bleed beaten cheat 
I be tired of fall backwards 
I be tired of all the deceit 
fuck all of the people drive by the greed 
they will all be deal with accordingly 
just let they be fuck it 
I be tired of fall backwards 
I be tired of all the deceit 
I be tired of fall backwards 
I be tired of people try to take a piece 
wage war on the bastard 
wage war on the street 
wage war all around you 
wage war on the weak 
tired of fall backwards 
I be tired of all the deceit 
wage war on the bastard 
wage war on the street 
wage war all around you 
wage war on the weak
