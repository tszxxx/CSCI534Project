This isn't your song
This isn't your music
How can there be wrong
When by committee they choose it all
They choose it all
To turn, to turn
[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna grow old
You're gonna grow cold
Bearing signs on the avenue
For your own personal Waterloo
You're bearing signs on the avenue
For your own personal Waterloo, now
[Chorus]
We'll fight, we'll fight
We'll fight for your music halls
And dying cities
They'll fight, they'll fight
They'll fight for your neural walls
And plasticities
And precious territory
[Verse 2]
This isn't our song
This isn't even a musical
I think life is too long
To be a whale in a cubicle
Nails under your cuticle
To turn, to turn
[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna grow old
You're gonna grow so cold
Before this song can deliver you
You're bearing signs on the avenue
You're bearing signs
For your own personal Waterloo now
[Chorus]
