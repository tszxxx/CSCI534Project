go to sleep my so and 
this manger for you bed 
you have a long road before you 
Rest you little head 
can you feel the weight of you glory 
do you understand the price 
or do the Father guard you heart for now 
so you can sleep tonight 
go to sleep my so and 
go and chase you dream 
this world can wait for one more moment 
go and sleep in peace 
I believe the glory of heaven 
be lie in my arm tonight 
but Lord I ask that he for just this moment 
simply be my child 
go to sleep my so and 
baby close you eye 
soon enough you will save the day 
but for now dear child of mine 
oh my Jesus sleep tight
