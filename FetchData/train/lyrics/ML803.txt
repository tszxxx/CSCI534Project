I'm high tonight, lookin' for some fun
Raging metal, with spikes and chains
-Chorus-
I'm a skull splitter
'Till the brink of dawn
Drank too many
Thousands on the lawn
I'm a skull splitter
Thrashing 'till the end
Kickin' ass, 'cause it feels great
Up at dawn, the rising dead
We're conquering, in Balingen
Raging metal with spikes
And chains
And all the women,
I'm a skull splitter
I'ma skull splitter
I'm a skull splitter
