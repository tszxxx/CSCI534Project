the very thought of you and I forget to do 
the little ordinary thing that everyone ought to do 
I be live in a kind of daydream I be happy as a king 
and foolish though it may seem to I that be everything 
the mere idea of you the longing here for you 
you will never know how slow the moment go till I be near to you 
I see you face in every flower you eye in star above 
it be just the thought of you the very thought of you my love 
I see you face in every flower you eye in star above 
just the thought of you the very thought of you my dear
