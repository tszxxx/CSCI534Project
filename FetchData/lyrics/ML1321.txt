Rubber of my soul
Where can you be
I wait patiently
My heart cries out
Pain inside
Where can you be
I wait patiently
When you're alone
Going get rough
Come back, come back, come back, baby
I've had enoug
Make me queen
Happy again
Here my cry
And ease my pain
When you're alone
Going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back, baby
I've had enough
Make me queen
Happy again
Hear me cry
Ease my pain
