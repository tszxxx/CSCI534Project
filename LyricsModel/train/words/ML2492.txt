white demon love song down the hall 
white demon shadow on the road 
back up you mind there be a call 
he be not come after all 
love this time 
she like the way he sing 
white demon love song 's in she dream 
white demon where be you selfish kiss 
white demon sorrow will arrange 
let 's not forget about the fear 
black invitation to a place that can not change 
while strangely holy come for a rain 
white demon wide you heart 's scope 
white demon who let you friend go 
white demon wide you heart 's scope 
white demon who let you friend go 
let we be in love 
let 's do old and grey 
I will not make you cry 
I will never stray 
I will do my part 
let we be in love tonight
