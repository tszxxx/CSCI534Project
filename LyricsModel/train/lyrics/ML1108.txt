[Intro: Gucci Mane]
I love things about her
I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me
I love the way she suck me
I love things about her
I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me
I love the way she suck me
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a trapaholic, all I do is ball
Tear the mall down
 now, trick
Don't flag me down, see me down town, 'Rari
I didn't mean to shit on you, excuse me, sorry
Verse so slick, make my video marvelous
Polo to the floor
, 
Ralph'd down like Carlton
Try the CEO, they gon' put you on a carton
I didn't mean no harm
, but my diamonds are dumb, plenty rocks on my arm
Me &amp; Rocko the Don, 
East Atlanta the Slum
Where I'm from, got a gun, in the club havin' fun
And after it's done, no more coaches to call it
After party? Bachelor party, they shoulda called it
It's Gucci
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I love things about her (But I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her)
I love things about her (But I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her)
[Verse 2: Rocko]
Man, I love the way she shake it
I like her 'cause she groovy
Love to see her naked, I love to watch her move it
I like her, she the coolest
Good head on her shoulders, I love the way she use it
Ayy, I like the way she fuck me, love the way she suck me
Love how every time we play, she catch it like rugby
I love she know what's up with me, she love me 'cause I'm gudda
I like a lot about her, though, but still don't love her
Still super cool, though, yeah, she my lil' buddy
She be sharper than a pencil, yeah, she my lil' cuddy
Shawty say I'm dirty, but when I see her, she wanna hug me
Super swagger charismatic, all my bitches love me
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I love things about her (But I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her)
I love things about her (But I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her)
[Verse 3: Webbie]
I love how she be swallowin' my nut, then she be throwin' me up
Love how she fuck, but still, I hate when she be blowin' me up
All the busters just sweat her, only ballers can get her
She a flipper, I love how she do whatever I tell her
Yeah, I like her a lot, but still, I don't love her at all
I hate pussy ass niggas and I'm in love with the mall
I got a crush on white diamonds and I got a thang for that kush
That sour diesel my favorite, you better watch how you look
Quick to take your lil' diva, then treat that ho like a slut
She was suckin' on Gucci, I had my dick in her butt
You know I'm bad bitch crazy, 187's my favorite
Infatuated with money, free Boosie-Boo, the streets pleading
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I love things about her (But I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her)
I love things about her (But I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her)
