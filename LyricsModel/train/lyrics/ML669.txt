Stop searching the sky for answers
Black girlfriends avenge, black girlfriends
My greatest gift is the lie we are given
This is the price you pay
For throwing your whole life away
Why can you know yourself
When your worlds were just one lie?
Still I rise from the ashes, from the ashes
Look inside, search for meaning
Truth cannot survive, truth cannot survive
Why fill the hate inside you? Why watch it burn?
You hurt the boardings but you, you never learn
This is the price you pay
For throwing your whole life away
Protect to understand
You never redemption
Still I rise from the ashes, from the ashes
Look inside, search for meaning
Truth cannot survive, truth cannot survive
Still I rise from the ashes, from the ashes
Look inside, search for meaning
Truth cannot survive, truth cannot survive
Watch it burn, the hate inside you
No return, ignore the warning signs
Still I rise from the ashes, from the ashes
Look inside, search for meaning
Truth cannot survive
Still I rise from the ashes, from the ashes
Look inside, search for meaning
Truth cannot survive, truth cannot survive
