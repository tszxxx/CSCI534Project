[Verse 1]
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
And they, they look at me and frown
They'd like to drive me from this town
They don't want me around
Because I believe in you
[Verse 2]
They, they show me to the door
They say, "Don't come back no more"
Because I don't be like they'd like me to
And I, I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone
Because I believe in you
[Chorus 1]
I'll believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
I'll believe in you even though we be apart
I'll believe in you even on the morning after
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Oh, when the night is disappearing
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart
[Verse 3]
Don't let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you
[Chorus 2]
I'll believe in you when winter turns to summer
I'll believe in you when white turn to black
I'll believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back
[Verse 4]
Don't let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I, I don't mind the pain
Don't mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
Because I believe in you
