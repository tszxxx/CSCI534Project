when I be lose I see you point towards the sun I know I be not the only one stand here and in the darkness I be walk through the night I could see you guide light , very clear this be you life this be you moment this be you life this be you moment when I be weak we both go walk on the sand we be walk hand in hand it appear once set we footprint when you carry I along it be then that I abandon my fear this be you life this be you moment this be you life this be you moment this be you life this be you moment this be you life this be you moment this be you moment this be you life you life this be you time
