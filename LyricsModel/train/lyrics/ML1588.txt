Your love means the world to me
Words could not express the joy you bring
Your love moves me tenderly
To have you by my side means everything.. I'll sing
Your love has the best of me
If I could give you more then that would be...
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
So give to me a vow and take my hand
Settle for my kiss
Cause it's all I can give
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
Your love means the world to me
Like the ocean wide your love runs deep
Your love.. oh baby.. moves me tenderly
Like the birds outside my window sing
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
So give to me a vow and take my hand
Settle for my kiss
Cause that's all I can give, baby
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
I can't bring you precious stars or paradise
And all these things are really on my mind
All that I can give to you is love so true
From the heart... oooh
Your love means the world to me (means the world)
No words, no words, express the joy you bring
Your love has the best of me
If I, if I could only give you everything.. baby
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
So give to me a vow and take my hand
Settle for my kiss
Cause that's all I can give, baby, yeah-yeah...
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
Settle for my love.. settle for my love
Settle for my love.. settle for my love
(repeat with adlibs to end)
