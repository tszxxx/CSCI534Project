the shackle be undone 
the bullet quit the gun 
the heat that be in the sun 
will keep we when there be none 
the rule have be disprove 
the stone it have be move 
the grave be now a groove 
all debt be remove 
oh can not you see what love have do 
oh can not you see what love have do 
oh can not you see what love have do 
what it be do to I 
love make strange enemy 
make love where love may please 
the soul and its striptease 
hate bring to its knee 
the sky over we head 
we can reach it from we bed 
you let I in you heart 
and out of my head head 
oh can not you see what love have do 
oh can not you see what love have do 
oh can not you see what love have do 
what it be do to I 
oh oh oh oh

please do not ever let I out of you 
I have get no shame oh no oh no 
oh can not you see what love have do 
oh can not you see 
oh can not you see what love have do 
what it be do to I 
I know I hurt you and I make you cry 
do everything but murder you and I 
but love leave a window in the sky 
and to love I rhapsodize 
to every broken heart 
for every heart that cry 
love leave a window in the sky 
and to love I rhapsodize
