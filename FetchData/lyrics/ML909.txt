There's no guarantee, yeah
Smiles in the makin'
You gotta fight the powers that be
Got so many forces
Stayin' on the scene
Givin' up all around me
Faces full o' pain
I try to play my music
They say my music's too loud
I tried talkin' about it
I got the big run around
And when I rolled with the punches
I got knocked on the ground
By all this
Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee, yeah
Smiles in the makin'
You gotta fight the powers that be
I don't understand it
People wanna see, yeah
Those that got the answers
Red tape in the way
I could take you in easy
That's just half the fun, oh boy
Seeking my satisfaction
Keeps me on the run
I try to play my music
They say my music's too loud
I kept talkin' about it
I got the big run around
And when I rolled with the punches
I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down
Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee
Smile's in the makin'
You gotta fight the powers that be
Fight it baby, yeah
If you and I can, we got the power
Come on, fight it, fight the power
Fight, fight it baby, baby, baby, yeah
Fight it, fight the power
Fight it, fight the power
Fight it, fight the power
