[Verse 1]
They say in chess you've got to
Kill the queen and then you've made it
Oh, I, do you?
A funny thing the king that
Gets himself assassinated
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
[Verse 2]
You took a town by storm
The mess you made was nominated
Oh, I, do you?
Now put away your welcome
Soon you'll find you've overstayed it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
[Verse 3]
The medicated state of mind, you've found is overrated
Oh, I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
[Bridge]
Come on, God, do I seem bulletproof?
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
