[Verse 1]
Tell me what you seen
Was it a dream?
Was I in it?
Life seems so obscene
Until it's over
Who knows?
[Pre-Chorus]
All I want is someone who can fill the hole
In the life I know
In between life and death
When there's nothing left
Do you wanna know?
[Chorus]
You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've know
And your friends on your own
[Verse 2]
Tell me if it's true
That I need you
You are changing
I've seen this road before down on this floor
It is hurting me
[Pre-Chorus]
All I want is someone who can fill the hole
In the life I know
In between life and death
When there's nothing left
Do you wanna know?
[Chorus]
You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've know
And your friends on your own
You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've know
And your friends on your own
[Outro]
Lies
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Lies
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Lies (I'm coming in on my own)
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Lies (I'm coming in on my own)
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Lies (I'm coming in on my own)
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
