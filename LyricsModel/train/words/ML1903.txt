intro half chorus andrea Ferro 
and 
Cristina Scabbia 

I can not tell you you be fall apart 
open you eye if you want to survive 
I want to tell you you love be a lie 
but 
I will not tell you I will not tell you 
I can not leave this I be fine inside it 
I do not feel bliss and I just keep hide 
I have be bur not so bad but I still play with fire 
sometimes naked truth be what I do not believe in

Cristina 

I can not tell you you be fall apart 
open you eye if you want to survive 
I want to tell you you love be a lie 
but 
I will not tell you I will not tell you 
I can not get so deep into this now 
I can not admit that I know what I know and 
I want to tell you you love be a lie 
I will not tell you I will not tell you 
it be hard to hear through the static again 
it be never clear until the rush of pain 
I will never tell you I be live a lie 
in this confusion I feel alive 
I have be bur not so bad but I still play with fire 
sometimes naked truth be what I can not believe in

I can not tell you you be fall apart 
open you eye if you want to survive 
I want to tell you you love be a lie 
but 
I will not tell you I will not tell you 
I can not get so deep into this now 
I can not admit that I know what I know and 
I want to tell you you love be a lie 
I will not tell you I will not tell you 
do not ever tell I I be fall apart 
do not ever tell I I will not survive 
do not ever tell I this love be a lie 
cause I be the lie I be the liar
