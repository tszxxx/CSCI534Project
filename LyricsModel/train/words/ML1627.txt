give I you eye 
I need sunshine 
give I you eye 
I need sunshine 
you blood 
you bone 
you voice 
and you ghost 
we have both be very brave 
walk around with both leg 
fight the scary day 
we both pull the trick out of we sleeve 
but I will believe in anything 
and you will believe in anything 
I say I will believe in anything 
and you will believe in anything 
if I could get the fire out from the wire 
I would share a life and you would share a life 
if I could take the fire out from the wire 
I would share a life and you would share a life 
if I could take the fire out from the water 
I would take you where nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn 
I say nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn 
and I could take another hit for you 
and I could take away you trip from you 
and I could take away the salt from you eye 
and take away what be be assault you 
and I could give you my apology 
by hand over all 
the olive tree 
and I could take away the shaking knee 
and I could give you all the olive tree 
oh look at the tree and look at my face 
and look at a place far away from here 
so give I you eye 
I need sunshine 
give I you eye 
I need sunshine 
you blood 
you bone 
you voice 
and you ghost 
we have both be very brave 
walk around with both leg 
fight the scary day 
we both pull the trick out of we sleeve 
but I will believe in anything 
and you will believe in anything 
if I could take the fire out from the wire 
I would share a life and you would share a life 
if I could take the fire out from the wire 
I would share a life and you would share a life 
if I could take the fire out from the wire 
I would take you where nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn 
I say nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn 
I say nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn either way 
about you blood 
you bone 
you voice 
and you ghost 
because nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn either way 
and now I will believe in anything and you will believe in anything 
because nobody know you 
and nobody give a damn either way
