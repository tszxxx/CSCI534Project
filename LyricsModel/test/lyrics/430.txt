I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
You're trying to make your mark in society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading all those high fashion magazines
The clothes you're wearin' girl are causing public scenes
I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
When I first met you girl you didn't have no shoes
Now you're walking 'round like you're front page news
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But you won't find my name in your book of who's who
I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
I'm not your stepping stone
