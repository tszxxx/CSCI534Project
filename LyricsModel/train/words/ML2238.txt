you think you know I you do not know shit 
I have see the world through you eye and it make I sick 
I have question all of you answer they be fuck lie 
I will not conform to you system I would rather die 
I burn it down just to watch it go 
I burn it down so everybody know 
I burn it down just to see it torch 
I burn it down I hate it to the core 
think you be a martyr not hard to see 
you want to rule the fuck world you get to get through I 
you iron fist will be break no soul to sell 
you think I will burn for my action see you in hell 
I burn it down I do it for myself 
I burn it down for I and no one else 
I burn it down just to watch it fall 
I burn it down I hate you fuck all 
I burn it down just to watch it go 
I burn it down so everybody know 
I burn it down just to see it torch 
I burn it down I hate it to the core
