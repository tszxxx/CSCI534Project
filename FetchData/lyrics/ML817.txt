[Verse 1, x2]
One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself my past comes true
[Chorus]
My life
[Verse 2]
One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself my self comes true
[Chorus]
[Outro]
I don't got time
I don't got nothing left for you
I don't got time
I don't got nothing left for you
