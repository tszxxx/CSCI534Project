I would like to see you in the morning light 
I would like to feel you when it come tonight 
now I be here and I be all alone 
still I know how it feel 
I be alone again 
try so hard to make you see 
but I could not find the word 
now the tear they fall like rain 
I be alone again without you 
alone again without you 
alone again without you 
alone again without you 
I say stay but you turn away 
try to say that it be I 
now I be here and I have lose my way 
now I know how it feel 
I be alone again 
repeat chorus 
I 
repeat chorus
