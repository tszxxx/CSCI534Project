[Intro]
Yeah! Yeah
[Verse 1]
All I've ever wanted was destiny to be fulfilled
It is in my hands, I must not fail, I must not fail
[Chorus]
Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always
This fire burns, always
[Verse 2]
This is the proving ground
As the heat begins to rise
Turn away from yesterday
Tomorrow's in my eyes, oh
[Bridge 1]
Nevermore to be held down
By the wings of history
Nevermore to be cast aside
This day is mine
[Chorus]
Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always
This fire burns, always
[Bridge 2]
I will not be denied in this final hour
I will not be denied, this day is mine
This passion inside me is burning, is burning
This passion inside me is burning, is burning
[Chorus/Outro]
Even through the darkest days
This fire burns, always (Always)
This fire burns (fire burns), always
Always (Always)
