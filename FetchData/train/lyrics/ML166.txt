[Intro]
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burning
[Verse 1]
To my surprise - listen - one hundred stories high
People getting loose y'all, getting down on the roof, do you hear?
The funk was flaming, out of control
It was so entertaining, when the boogie started to explode
[Hook]
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
[Verse 2]
Satisfaction, came in the chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, 'till I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody's going strong, and that is when my spark got hot
[Hook]
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
[Bridge]
Up above my head, I hear music in the air
That makes me know there's somebody somewhere
[Verse 3]
Satisfaction, came in a chain reaction, do you hear?
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody's going strong, that is when my spark got hot
[Hook]
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
[Outro]
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
[Just can't stop]
(When my spark gets hot)
Burning (x23)
I don't know if you understand what i'm talking about
I'm not talking about burning down a building
It's coming from the soul
(Just can't stop)
Soul funk
(When my spark gets hot)
Burning in my soul
[Just can't stop]
Ow
Now, listen
Don't you rescue me
(Just can't stop)
Let my spirit burn free
(When my spark gets hot)
Don't you rescue me, no
[Just can't stop]
Let my spirit burn free
(When my spark gets hot)
Everybody say ow
[Ow]
Say ow
[Ow]
You feel the spirit tonight
[Ow]
Disco funk
[Ow]
Come here on the floor
Let's rock some more
I'm on fire
[Burning, Burning]
I'm on fire
[Burning, Burning]
Let the good times roll
[Burning, Burning]
Do you feel alright?
[Burning]
Feel pretty good, y'all
[Burning]
People getting loose
[Burning]
Getting down on the groove
[Burning]
The flame is higher
[Burning]
Is higher
[Burning]
Alright
[Burning]
I can't get enough
[Burning]
I want some more
[Burning]
I want some more
[Burning]
I'm burning
[Burning]
I'm burning
[Burning]
Burning in the soul
Burning, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
[Just can't stop]
(When my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
[Just can't stop]
(When my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
[Just can't stop]
(When my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
[Just can't stop]
(When my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
[Just can't stop]
(When my spark gets hot)
[Hook]
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
