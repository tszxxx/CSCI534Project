[Verse 1]
We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned
We must believe our spirits know somehow
Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now, ooh
New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control, ooh baby
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on
[Chorus]
Take my heart and lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love
I'm deep in the miracle of you, ooh
[Verse 2]
When we feel excitement rise
We'll share the secrets found in lovers eyes
You'll speak the words of love
I'll speak them too
Baby, ain't no stopping me when I'm near you
Honey, take this heart
[Chorus]
And lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love
I'm deep in the miracle
(Deep in the miracle of you)
(Light the way so I can see, light the way so I can see)
Baby, yeah
[Bridge]
I...I keep telling you
(You make a miracle, baby; you make a miracle)
I need you to bring me the miracle
(Tell me, let your heart speak)
Honey, won't you
(Love me)
Baby, I see
I know that there's no good, baby
Can you show me that your desire is complete and I'm all yours
[Chorus]
Lead me into love
Light the way so I can see
(Show me)
Lead me into love
(Teach me the way, baby)
Deep in the miracle, deep in the miracle
Lead me into love
(Come on, show me)
Light the way so I can see
(Shine, shine your light on me)
Lead me into love
(I can't see without you)
Deep in the miracle, deep in the miracle
(I can't move without you, I can't live without you)
Lead me into love
Light the way so I can see
(Baby, shine, shine your light on me)
Lead me into love
Deep in the miracle, deep in the miracle
