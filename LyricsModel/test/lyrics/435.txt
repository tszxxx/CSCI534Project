[Verse 1]
I've took a picture that I'll have to send
People here are friendly and content
People here are colorful and bright
The flowers often bloom at night
[Chorus]
Amanita is the name
The flowers cover everything
The flowers cover everything
[Verse 2]
There's something here I find hard to ignore
There's something that I've never seen before
Amanita is the name, they cover over everything
[Chorus]
The flowers cover everything
They cover over everything (Amanita is the name)
The flowers cover everything
[Bridge]
Look into the sun
Don't look into the sun
[Chorus]
The flowers cover everything
They cover over everything
The flowers cover everything
The flowers cover everything
They cover over everything
The flowers cover everything
[Outro]
There's something that I've never seen before
The flowers often bloom at night
Amanita is the name, they cover over everything
