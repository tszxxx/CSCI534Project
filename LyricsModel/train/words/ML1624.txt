nothing we be do nothing 
sit and wonder why nothing be happen 
everyone be there 
in a wooden chair 
do nothing 
still do nothing 
drinking smoking 
nothing be happen 
no one seem to care 
in they wooden chair 
do nothing 
I go walk through the park 
underneath a moldy sky 
think yes I think this place 
would be such a lonely place to die 
such a lonely place to die 
nothing we be do nothing 
literally freeze stiff from nothing happen 
something have to change 
cause it be no longer feeling strange 
to do nothing ad nauseam nothing 
and feel acutely every millisecond pass 
we can ignore that this be sad 
because we know that it all add up to nothing 
I go walk through the park 
underneath the moldy sky 
think about all the different way that would make lonely way to die 
all the lonely way to die
