Say it over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
Tell me ever and ever so sweet
Soft words of love be repeating
Just like an old valentine
When you say I love you
The same old i love you
They whisper in stories and plays
You can change i love you
Same old i love you
To oh such a heaveny phrase
So say it softly and gently and then
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
