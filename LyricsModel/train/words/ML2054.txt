Jesus we king kind and good 
be humbly bear in a stable of wood 
and the lowly beast around he stand 
Jesus we king kind and good 
I say the donkey shaggy and brown 
I carry he mother up and down 
I carry he mother to Bethlehem town 
I say the donkey shaggy and brown 
I say the ox this be my hay 
I give he my manger it be here that he lay 
I give he my manger it be here that he lay 
I say the ox this be my hay 
I say the sheep with pearly horn 
I give he my wool for a blanket warm 
he wear my coat on Christmas morn 
I say the sheep with pearly horn 
I say the dove from the rafter high 
I sang he to sleep that he would not cry 
we sang he to sleep my love and I 
I say the dove from the rafter high 
and so every heart by some good spell 
in the stable dark be glad to tell 
of the gift that he give to Emmanuel 
of the gift that he give to Emmanuel
