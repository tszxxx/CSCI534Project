[Verse]
I live out here in the wind and the pouring rain
Somewhere between 14th Avenue and Main
In the summer heat, winter's freezing snow
You see I got nowhere else to go
[Chorus]
Got no home sweet home
Into this world, some are bound to roam
And it's a long hard road we've known
On the way to home sweet home
[Verse]
People pass by, they don't see me here
And if they do, they wish I would disappear
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
It could be them out there looking for a home
[Chorus]
For a home sweet home
Into this world, some are bound to roam
And it's a long hard road we've known
On the way to home sweet home
[Verse]
Oh to have a place to lay my head
A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday a kind soul will come along
Help me to find my way back where I belong
[Chorus]
Back to a home sweet home
Into this world, some are bound to roam
And it's a long hard road we've known
On the way to home sweet home
[Outro]
Sweet home
All God's children lookin' for a home
And it's a long hard road we've known
All the way to home sweet home
