[Verse 1]
I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song
[Chorus]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[Verse 2]
She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief
[Chorus]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[Bridge]
Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight
[Verse 3]
And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet loving brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul
[Chorus]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
