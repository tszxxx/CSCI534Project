If I ever get lucky I'll find the right woman for me
She'll be all I ever dreamed of and all that I want her to be
She'll have patience and kindness and interest in things that I do
If I ever get lucky I'll find a lady like you
If I ever get wealthy I'll build a mansion somewhere
And the woman who loves me will be queen of the castle we share
There'll be vineyards and roses and children that look like you do
If I ever get lucky I'll find a lady like you
If I ever get lucky I'll find someone who needs a good man
And she'll hold out her finger and cherish this wedding band
And with the hand of a loser I'll do what a loser can do
And if I ever get lucky I'll find a lady like you
If I ever get lucky I'll find someone who needs a good man
And she'll hold out her finger and cherish this wedding band
And with the hand of a loser I'll do what a loser can do
And if I ever get lucky I'll find a lady like you
If I ever get lucky I'll find a lady like you
