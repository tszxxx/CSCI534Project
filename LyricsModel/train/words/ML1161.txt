if you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew 
that be my heart serenade you 
my prelude to a kiss 
if you hear a song that grow from my tender sentimental woe 
that be my heart try to compose 
a prelude to a kiss 
though it be just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much 
you could turn it to a symphony a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch 
oh how my love song gently cry for the tenderness within you eye 
my love be a prelude that never die 
a prelude to a kiss
