you make a man out of I 
but you be not satisfied 
you do not believe what you see 
you do not believe when I 
get a million thing on my mind cause of you 
I do not know what I be go to do 
I only want to love you 
you only want a taste 
my ambition to woo you 
be all the time that we waste 
time that we waste 
why do not you set I free yeah 
why do not you set I free 
why do not you set I free yeah 
why do not you set I free 
and every time that I think about the better day 
remember how we would kiss 
when we be high on haze 
we never know about the way thing work 
I still need to forget 
cause when you want protection 
you use to call out my name yes you do 
and all this changing direction 
be not make I feel the same about you 
why do not you set I free yeah 
why do not you set I free 
why do not you set I free yeah 
why do not you set I free 
all you get to do be just set I free 
so easy
