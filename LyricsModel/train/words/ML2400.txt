she know the word be cold 
and the heart 's on fire 
trap by these wall of steel 
in a world on fire 
crush by a word so true 
tear by she eye so blue 
and my heart 's desire 
run from the darkest moon 
and take I higher 
just let it go let it flow 
let it speak till you know 
that I be on fire 
and turn when you can not see 
the truth here inside of I 
and I who oh oh I see you when you be here whohoho 
I who oh oh I see you when you be here 
who oh oh 
so tear down these wall of pain 
and take it higher 
so let it come let it come 
just let it speak from the heart 
cause I be on fire 
run when you can not stay 
just run when you can not stay 
cause I who oh oh I see you when you be here 
who oh oh I who oh oh I see you when you be here who oh oh 
so let it come down just let it come down 
oh I and oh I who oh oh 
I see you when you be here 
who oh oh I 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
