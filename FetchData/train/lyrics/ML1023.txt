[Chorus]
You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again
[Verse 1]
When you were gone
I met a friend
She taught me how to
Live in the end
[Chorus]
You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again
[Verse 2]
Are her eyes
Brown or blue?
How does she keep her
Static cool
My heart and soul
Are rocked up in her eyes
A little blink, yea, I recognize
A little blink, yea, that's my prize
A white horse
Sitting right there by her side
Hard to ignore
Hard to disguise
She'll never ever
Realize
[Chorus]
You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again
[Bridge]
When you were gone
I was out of my mind
[Outro]
I had a friend who laughed all the time
I had a friend who cried all the time
I had a friend who screamed all the time
I had a friend who lied all the time
