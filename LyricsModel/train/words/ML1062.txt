when my soul be lose 
there be no one around 
but you be there for I 
when the rain come down 
into every sunny day 
a little rain must fall 
and without the rain upon we 
would we ever grow 
like so many other I be too afraid of change 
till I put my trust in you 
you take away my pain 
I allow my fear to take hold of I 
have nowhere to run cause 
I be too deep 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
wait for a better day that seem so far away 
even though my faith be shaky you show I the way 
I be search for a way that I could make it through 
figure out what I do wrong 
I do not trust in you 
I allow my fear to take hold of I 
have nowhere to run cause 
I be too deep 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
do not really matter how hard the rain be go to fall 
cause through any weather there be someone I can call 
Storm cloud may rise 
strong wind may blow 
you say you would never leave I anywhere I go 
I allow my fear to take hold of I 
have nowhere to run cause 
I be too deep 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I 
let the rain fall down on I
