[Verse 1]
Said farewell to my last hotel, it never was much kind of abode
Glasgow town never brought me down when I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty, and the Kendal freeway is fast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last
[Chorus]
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away
[Verse 2]
M6 south down Liverpool, where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam, he came from Birmingham, but he never will be found
Doin' fine when a london sign, greets me like a long lost friend
Mister motor won't you check her out, she's gotta take me back again
[Chorus]
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away
[Verse 3]
Got no time for a rum and lime, I wanna get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus, I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day upon the motorway, where the carburetors blast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last
[Chorus]
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away
[Outro]
Say bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
