where would all the time go 
it be start to fly 
see how the hand go 
wave goodbye 
and you know I get so forgetful 
when I look in you eye 
now she be walk backwards 
through a parade 
and I be stuck in the shadow 
block the shade 
and there be not no way to sweep up 
the mess that we have make 
she get dress up like a pillow so she be always in bed 
Flowers for the sick and dead 
she be on the go way too fast and way too slow 
she will turn to stone at hospital and funeral home 
and when the fog rise 
somebody sigh who be not in disguise anymore 
there be nothing to keep you 
from fall in love 
it start at the bottom 
and come from above 
like piece of a puzzle 
like a hand in a glove 
she get dress up like a pillow so she be always in bed 
Flowers for the sick and dead 
she be on the go way too fast and way too slow 
she will turn and stop at hospital and funeral home 
and when the tide rise 
somebody sink and be go in the blink of a eye
