I dig a pygmy 
by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf aids 
phase one in which Doris get she oat 
two of we ride nowhere 

spend someone 's 
hard earn pay 
you and I Sunday driving 

not arrive 
on we way back home 
we be on we way home 
we be on we way home 
we be go home 
two of we send postcard writing letter 
on my wall 
you and I burn match 

lift latch 
on we way back home 
we be on we way home 
we be on we way home 
we be go home 
you and I have memory 
longer than the road that stretch out ahead 
two of we wear raincoat stand solo 
in the sun 
you and I chase paper get nowhere 
on we way back home 
we be on we way home 
we be on we way home 
we be go home 
you and I have memory 
longer than the road that stretch out ahead 
two of we wear raincoat stand solo 
in the sun 
you and I chase paper get nowhere 
on we way back home 
we be on we way home 
we be on we way home 
we be go home 
we be go home 
better believe it 
Goodbye
