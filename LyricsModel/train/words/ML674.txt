shake you love 
I just can not shake you love 
shake you love 
I just can not shake you love 
shake you love 
I just can not shake 
shake you love 
I just can not shake you love 
I be under a spell again 
Boy I be wonder why 
this be not a game of love 
but a emotional tie 
I be try to figure out my heart 
but I can not offer you proof 
of why we should never be apart 
and that be the 
that be the truth 
oh 
do you know why I stop and stare 
and smile when you walk by 
and how I call you up at night 
I hang up the phone and I cry 
if I never get to know you so well 
maybe I would be fine 
baby you know that I can not tell 
why you should be 
you should be mine oh 
ooh 
I know what you be think 
I see it in you eye 
you want to give 
we love another try 
I be so glad you realize 
I can not 
shake it 
you love 
can not shake 
just can not shake you love
