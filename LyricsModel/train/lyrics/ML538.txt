{​Verse 1}​
It would be like the sky that's never sunny
It would be like the bee that can't make honey
Or maybe like the fallin snow that never melts
Like always hearing of your touch but never felt
It's like the vase that holds no flowers
{​chorus}​
Never wanna sleep with out you
Never wanna wake with out you
I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance with out you
(Cause) I'll never do my best with out you
I never wanna leave this life abundantly
Hallelujah
{​verse 2}​
It would be like the game that has no winner
Like knowing loves behind the door you cannot enter
Like knowing joys in a mornin that never comes
(Kinda like) What life would be if God didn't send his son
It's kinda like a heart with no love flowing through it
{​chorus}​
(I) Never wanna sleep with out you
(And I) Never wanna wake with out you
(No) I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance with out you
(Cause) I never do my best with out you
( Oh Father) I never wanna leave this life abundantly
{​chorus}​
Never wanna sleep with out you
Never wanna wake with out you
I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance with out you
(Cause) I never do my best with out you
I never wanna leave this life abundantly
Since you came in my life your source of my abundant living
