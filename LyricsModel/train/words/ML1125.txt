it be down by the salley garden 
my love and I do meet 
she cross the salley garden 
with little snow white foot 
she bid I to take life easy 
as the leave grow on the tree 
but I be young and foolish 
and with she I do not agree 
in a field down by the river 
my love and I do stand 
and upon my lean shoulder 
she lay she snow white hand 
she bid I take life easy 
as the grass grow on the weir 
but I be young and foolish 
and now I be full of tear 
it be down by the salley garden 
my love and I do meet 
she cross the salley garden 
with little snow white foot 
she bid I to take life easy 
as the leave grow on the tree 
but I be young and foolish 
and with she I do not agree
