[Verse 1]
Tired of living like my days are bad
When I open up my eyes, I'm glad
And I can't complain 'bout yesterday
'Cause today's a brand new day
Comb my hair and though some like it wrong
Jump in my ride because it's on
And I'm gone, I'm gone
[Chorus]
I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord
'Cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
(No matter what nobody say)
Even though it's cloudy
I can see the sun rays (See the sun rays)
Oh, 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day
[Verse 2]
Life just can't get no better than this
Mother Nature's given us a kiss
'Cause tomorrow I'm glad I didn't miss
Let's take advantage of days like this
When the night time does finally hit
There'll be no reason for guns
It'll be fun, fun, fun, fun
[Chorus]
I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord
'Cause it's a beautiful day
(It's a beautiful day)
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy
I can see the sun rays
(Even though it's cloudy I can see the sun rays)
Oh, 'cause it's a beautiful day
(Oh, it's a beautiful day)
No matter what nobody say
(No matter, no matter, no matter)
'Cause it's a beautiful day (Beautiful day), a beautiful day
(Beautiful day)
[Bridge]
Everything is good because I'm living and I'm healthy
(My health is good)
I'm not too concerned 'bout being poor or being wealthy
(That's for sure)
I feel really good about this blessing given to me
(Thank you, Lord)
Nothing in this world could ever take all my joy from me
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
It's beautiful
A beautiful day, a beautiful day
A beautiful day, a beautiful day
[Chorus]
I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord
'Cause it's a beautiful day
(Opened my eyes and prayed)
No matter what nobody say
(No matter what nobody say)
Even though it's cloudy
I can see the sun rays
(Even though, even though I can see the sun rays)
Oh, 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day
[Bridge]
I don't have a complaint in the world
I am doing so good
Without, without, without the money
Without, without, without the stress
Without, without, without the people, yeah
Beautiful day, beautiful day, beautiful day
[Chorus]
I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord
'Cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
(Beautiful day)
Even though it's cloudy
I can see the sun rays
(Even though it's cloudy I can see the sun rays)
Oh, 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day
I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord
'Cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy
I can see the sun rays
Oh, 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day
