[Verse]
Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me
So I can be on my miserable way
[Chorus]
I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh
I don't
Live today!
It's such a shame to waste your time away like this
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
Well, I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't tell you, baby; but, uh
I don't
Live today!
It's such a shame to spend the time away like this
Existing
[Outro]
Yeah!
Ow!
Yeah!
Oh, no
Oh, there ain't no life nowhere
Uh-huh, hmm
Are you experienced?
Get experienced
Get experienced
Are you experienced?
