How long
Baby how long
Has that evening
Train been gone
How long how long
Baby how long
Went to the station
Did'nt see no train
But in my heart
I got an acin pain
Omkvd
I feel discusted
I feel so bad
Thinking about the good time
That i once have had
Omkvd
I could see the green grass
Groving on the hill
Ain't seen no green
On a dollar bill
Omkvd
You gonna be sorry
You feel so blue
If you would leave me
I declare i won't want you
Omkvd
Don't have no money
Wanna ride the train
I'd rather ride baby
Than to be with you again
How long
How long
Baby how long
