[Chorus]
Slow down slow down old world
There's no hurry cause
My life ain't mine anymore
[Verse 1]
I lived too fast
Now it's too late to worry
And I'm too blue to cry anymore
I once was a fool for the women
Now I'm just a fool nothing more
[Chorus]
Slow down slow down old world
There's no hurry cause
My life ain't mine anymore
[Verse 2]
I once had a way with the women
Till one got away with my heart
[Chorus]
Slow down slow down old world
There's no hurry cause
My life ain't mine anymore
