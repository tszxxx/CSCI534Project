They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied
"Something here inside cannot be denied"
They said "someday you'll find
All who love are blind"
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
"When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes"
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
"When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes"
