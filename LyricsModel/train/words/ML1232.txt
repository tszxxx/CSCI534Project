I hear the bell on Christmas day 
they old familiar carol play 
and mild and sweet they song repeat 
of peace on earth good will to I and 
and the bell be ringe 
like a choir they be sing 
in my heart I hear they 
peace on earth good will to I and 
and in despair I bow my head 
there be no peace on earth I say 
for hate be strong and mock the song 
of peace on earth good will to I and 
but the bell be ringe 
like a choir singing 
do anybody hear they 
peace on earth good will to I and 
then ring the bell more loud and deep 
God be not dead nor doth he sleep 
the wrong shall fail the right prevail 
with peace on earth good will to I and 
then ringe sing on its way 
the world revolve from night to day 
a voice a chime a chant sublime 
of peace on earth good will to I and 
and the bell they be ringe 
like a choir they be sing 
and with we heart we will hear they 
peace on earth good will to I and 
do you hear the bell they be ringe 
the life the angel singing 
open up you heart and hear they 
peace on earth good will to I and 
peace on earth peace on earth 
peace on earth good will to I and
