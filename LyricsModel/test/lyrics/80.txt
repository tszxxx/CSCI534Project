Ain't got no job, ain't got no smoke
Ain't got a car, his life's a joke
Living on the skids, thinks the world's just fine
Forgot what he did, dancin' on the breadline
No one there to bind him
Nothin' to remind him
Nowhere left to find him
Ooh, about to lose his lifeline
He's dancin' on the breadline
[Short Instrumental Break]
Forgot who he is, forgot who he was
Used to call the shots, now he can't connect the dots
A mover and shaker, getting closer to his maker
Lower than a hemline, dancin' on the breadline
No one there to bind him
Nothin' to remind him
Nowhere left to find him
Nowhere...
Ooh, about to lose his lifeline
He's lookin' for a headline
Ooh, sniffin' up the white lines
He's dancin' on the breadline
He's dancin' on the breadline
[Short Instrumental Break]
Watch him dance
[Short Instrumental Break]
Ooh, about to lose his lifeline
He's lookin' for a headline
Ooh, sniffin' up the white lines
He's dancin' on the breadline
Ooh, about to lose his lifeline
He's dancin' on the breadline
Yeah...
No one, nothing, nowhere
Dancin' on the breadline
Dancin' on the breadline
He forgot and he ain't got nothin'
