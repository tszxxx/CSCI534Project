CHORUS I have be lonely for so long do not seem like happiness will come along I have be lonely for so long do not seem like happiness will come along these be not rain cloud over my head everybody 's throw rock in my bed just can not seem to get ahead in life oh , nothing I do ever turn out right wo not somebody help I please CHORUS I lay awake every night try to figure out how to make thing right there 's get to be a better way I know to shake this monkey off cause he 's make I so wo not somebody help I please CHORUS yes I know what it feel like to be lonely to have you friend turn they back on you yes I have be lonely to never know the real mean of peace of mind , yes I lay awake every night try to figure out how to make thing right there 's get to be a better way I know to shake this monkey off cause he 's make I so wo not somebody help I please CHORUS
