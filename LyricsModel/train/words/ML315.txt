there must be another way 
when she be go to a better place 
and loneliness will hurt you 
if you can not get through the night 
if every moment start to fade 
and dawn be just a hour away 
I feel she be watch over 
and it get I through the night 
it make I wonder what you would say 
it be take I back to the month of May 
when I watch you do it 
I be think back to what we would share 
in many way I be already there 
and I watch you do it 
do not turn the light on 
cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 
another walk to take 
another lonesome evening spend without you there 
and only those who hurt you 
will say patience be a virtue and it be be so long 
and I can not think about it 
no I can not figure it out 
cause just how real you be feel 
every time that you be appear leave no room for doubt 
it make I wonder what you would say 
it be take I back to the month of May 
when I watch you do it 
I be think back to what we would share 
in many way I be already there 
and I watch you do it
