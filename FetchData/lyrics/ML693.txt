[Chorus: Mark Stein 
with Vince Martell
 (Tim Bogert &amp; Carmine Appice)]
Set me free, why don't you babe
Get out my life, why don't you babe (Ooooh)
You really don't want me
You just, 
keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just, 
keep me hangin' on
[Verse 1: Mark Stein]
Why do you keep comin' around
Playing with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me try to make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me
[Chorus: Mark Stein 
with Vince Martell
 (Tim Bogert &amp; Carmine Appice)]
Set me free, why don't you babe
Get out my life, why don't you now (Ooooh)
You really don't want me
You just, 
keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just, 
keep me hangin' on
[Verse 2: Mark Stein]
You said, when we broke up
You just wanna be friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
(Give it to me)
[Bridge: Mark Stein 
with Vince Martell
 (Tim Bogert &amp; Carmine Appice)]
You know I need love
(Set me free, why don't you babe)
Talkin' 'bout love
(Get out my life, why don't you babe) (Ooooh)
You really don't want me
You just, 
keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just, 
keep me hangin' on
[Refrain: Mark Stein (Tim Bogert &amp; Carmine Appice)]
Get out my life, why don't you babe (Ooooh)
Get out my life, why don't you babe (Ooooh)
Get out my life, why don't you babe (Ooooh)
Get out my life, why don't you babe (Ooooh)
[Outro: Mark Stein]
(Hey!)
(Come on to me, yeah!)
(Come on)
