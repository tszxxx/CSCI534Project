the strangest think come to I on this morning as I awoke to greet the come dawn the sun be hardly peak through the garden it feel that with everything I be one then I wish that I could come back as a flower as a flower as a flower how I wish that I could come back as a flower as a flower to spread the sweetness of love to spread the sweetness of love the dew have finish make love to many a rainbow smell sweet be in the air I envy all the silence I see grow so unmove by thing outside of themselves then how I wish that I could come back as a flower as a flower as a flower how I wish that I could come back as a flower as a flower to spread the sweetness of love how I wish that I could come back as a flower oh , as a flower as a flower how I wish that I could come back as a flower as a flower to spread the sweetness of love to spread the sweetness of love
