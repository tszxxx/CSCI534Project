[Verse 1]
Well (Bring it to Jerome, bring it to Jerome)
Everyday I work (Bring it to Jerome)
Bringing home my pay (Bring it to Jerome)
Come to find out, baby (Bring it to Jerome)
You're giving my money away (Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
[Verse 2]
Tell me, baby (Bring it to Jerome)
What you trying to do? (Bring it to Jerome)
You ain't treating me mama (Bring it to Jerome)
Like you used to do (Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
[Verse 3]
Tell me, mama (Bring it to Jerome)
Whats wrong with you? (Bring it to Jerome)
You know, pretty baby (Bring it to Jerome)
I'm so crazy about you (Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
(Bring it to Jerome)
[Bridge]
All you pretty women
Bring it to my home
You don't have to worry
I won't do you no wrong
[Chorus]
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
[Verse 3]
Looka here, pretty baby
This mess I won't stand
All the other women
Say you got another man
[Chorus]
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
[Harmonica solo]
