'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
(Spoken)
Mama just looked at him and said, "Son
Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when his died
All he left us was alone."
Hey, mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow or steal to pay his bills
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin'
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, "Son
Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when his died
All he left us was alone."
