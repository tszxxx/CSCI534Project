I send out season greeting to all we same old friend 
the tree be trim and in you favorite place 
I deck the hall with holly build a snowman in the lane 
I sing Jingle bell on a one horse open sleigh 
but white Christmas make I blue 
every time I hear it play I think of you 
I remember all the good one we know 
oh white Christmas make I blue 
I be try to be happy I know you would want I to 
be sad at Christmas time be not right 
I be keep we tradition wish you be here 
on Christmas eve I still sing Silent night 
but White Christmas make I blue 
every time I hear it play I think of you 
I remember all the good one we know 
oh white Christmas make I blue 
oh white Christmas make I blue
