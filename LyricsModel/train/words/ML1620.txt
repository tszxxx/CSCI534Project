you do not know it be a dream 
you do not know if it be real life 
you do not know it be a dream 
you do not know if it be real life 
that be what it feel like 
to you 
you do not know anything 
you just know that it feel right 
that be when you realize 
it be true 
out of touch waste time 
my heart 
everything I think I know I lose in you 
you be turn I around 
you do not wonder why 
you just know to believe I 
cause I make it easy 
to choose 
I do not question love 
I just go where you lead I 
love be so easy 
to lose 
instrumental interlude

Eyay love eyay eyay it be love
