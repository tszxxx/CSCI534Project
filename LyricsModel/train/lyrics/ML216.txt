[Verse 1]
I can't escape this hell
So many times I've tried
But I’m still caged inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself
[Chorus]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal)
(This animal)
[Verse 2]
I can’t escape myself
(I can’t escape myself)
So many times I’ve lied
(So many times I’ve lied)
But there’s still rage inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself
[Chorus]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
[Bridge]
Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can’t escape this hell
[Refrain]
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
[Chorus]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
[Outro]
This animal I have become
