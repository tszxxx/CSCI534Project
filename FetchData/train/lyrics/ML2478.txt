Searching for home
Left all alone
Lifes on a stroll
Love comes and go's
When will it end
Nobody knows, I chose my road
I know Im a long way from home
Searching for home
Maybe Im wrong
I know what I feel
Somewhere its out there
In it Im real
But when will it end
Nobody knows, I chose my road
I know Im a long way from home
Searching for home
My home
Searching for home
And you said the journies just footsteps home
In my head, Ill never be alone
And you said my life will tell a story
But Im still none the wiser, and I can't understand
Searching for home
Left all alone
I chose my road
I know Im a long way from home
Searching for home
My home
Im all alone
Searching for home
