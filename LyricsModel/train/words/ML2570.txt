I remember long ago 
how I wonder where I would go 
while the blizzard 
cold wind and snow 
pound outside my window 
California sunset 
go down in the West 
all the color in the sky 
kiss another day goodbye 
land of beauty 
Space and light 
land of promise 
land of might 
you be my home now 
and it be true 
California here be to you 
California sunset 
go down in the West 
all the color in the sky 
kiss another day goodbye 
California sunset 
go down in the West 
all the color in the sky 
kiss another day goodbye 
the golden state
