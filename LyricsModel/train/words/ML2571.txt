look for a cure within the human race 
eliminate the poor how much longer will it take 
burn up the tent of the rank and file 
exterminate they life crack a demon smile 
crush down cave in we will to live 
get rid of man 's mistake 
to take a lose life lock it up break it dow and 
how much more can we take 
fight for freedom fight authority 
fight for anything my country 'tis of I 
cry for absolution it be not the end for I 
a last minute pardon one final reprieve 
resist the war machine do not get in it be path 
fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath 
crush down cave in we will to live 
get rid of man 's mistake 
to take a lose life lock it up break it dow and 
do not know how much more I can take 
fight for freedom fight authority 
fight for anything my country 'tis of I 
fight fight 
fight fight 
fight 
fight for freedom fight authority 
fight for anything it be my country 
fight for freedom fight authority 
fight for anything my country 'tis of I
