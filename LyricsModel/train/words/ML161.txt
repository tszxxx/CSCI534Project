time and time again I see 
a love that seem strong be not mean to be 
broken heart do not always mend 
leave too unsure to try love again 
but just between you and I 
baby I know we love will be 
just between you and I 
always I know we love will be 
just between you and I 
lover often seem to say 
heart can be blind to love go astray 
always it be the same old song 
someone be be hurt by a love that be go wrong 
just between you and I 
baby I know we love will be 
just between you and I 
always I know we love will be 
just between you 
just between you and I 
word be sometimes hard to find 
the silence can be so unkind 
you always help I find my way 
the love that we share grow stronger each day 
just between you and I 
baby I know we love will be 
just between you and I 
always I know we love will be 
Seulement entre toi et moi 
means that we love will always be 
just between you and I 
baby I know we love will be 
just between you 
just between you and I
