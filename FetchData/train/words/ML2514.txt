although my lover life in a place that I can not live I kind of find I like a life this lonely it rip and pierce I in place I can not see I love the rip of nerve , the rip that wake I so I be dissatisfied , I love dissatisfied I love to feel as though it 's more than I need so come on home so come on home so come on home Home you be where you want to be , I be where I want to be come on , we be chase everything we have ever want replace you easily , replace pathetically I flirt with every flighty thing that fall my way but how I need you when I need you let 's not forget we be so strong , so bloody strong come on home so come on home so come on home Home Blue light fall upon you perfect skin Falls and you draw back again Falls and this be how I feel and I can not forget , and I can not forget come on home so come on home so come on home but do not forget to leave
