Heaven be the whole of we heart 
and Heaven do not tear you apart 
yeah Heaven be the whole of we heart 
and Heaven do not tear you apart 
there be too many king 
wanna hold you dow and 
and a world at the window 
go underground 
there be a hole in the sky 
where the sun do not shine 
and a clock on the wall 
and it count my time 
and Heaven be the whole of we heart 
and Heaven do not tear you apart 
yeah Heaven be the whole of we heart 
and Heaven do not tear you apart 
there be a song on the air 
with a love you line 
and a face in a glass 
and it look like mine 
and I be stand on ice when I say 
that I do not hear plane 
and I scream at the fool 
wanna jump my train 
and Heaven be the whole of we heart 
and Heaven do not tear you apart 
yeah Heaven be the whole of ours heart 
and Heaven do not tear you apart 
yeah Heaven 
ah Heaven
