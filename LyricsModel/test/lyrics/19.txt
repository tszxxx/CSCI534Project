[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do
[Chorus]
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
[Verse 2]
I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me, I hate everyone
[Chorus]
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
[Bridge]
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
[Chorus]
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
[Outro]
This world full of you
This world full of you
This world full of you
