and I will tell you it be all all right 
you say you heart be open but you love be bad 
you try and use you word but you only get what you get 
by this time you will try to fall apart 
I will not let you disconnect you heart 
and I will tell you it be all right 
I will take the long way home 
be there nothing else I should know 
I will take the long way home 
be there nothing else I should know 
and I will tell you it be all all right
