When the snow is falling heavy
And youre weary from the weight
When the drift is deep
and all you see is white
May a Christmas moon surprise you
Turning snow into a stage
Showing winter diamonds
hiding in plain sight
Cuz even heavy days have something to reveal
And the wounds remind us of the one who heals
So I say God bless us
God bless us
God bless us
Everyone, everyone
