if not for you Babe , I could not find the door could not even see the floor I 'o be sad and blue if not for you if not for you Babe , I 'o lay awake all night wait for the morning light to shine in through but it would not be new if not for you if not for you , my sky would fall Rain would gather too without you love , I 'o be nowhere at all I 'o be lose if not for you and you know it 's true if not for you , my sky would fall Rain would gather too without you love , I 'o be nowhere at all oh , what would I do if not for you if not for you Winter would have no spring could not hear the robin sing I just would not have a clue anyway it would not ring true if not for you if not for you if not for you if not for you if not for you
