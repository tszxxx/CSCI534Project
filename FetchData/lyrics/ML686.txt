[Verse 1]
Why do people smile when no one's smiling?
It's cause they're thinking of someone they're loving
Keep on believing we are meant to be and
Nothing's stopping you and me from going to heaven
Sweetest love
[Hook]
I got the sweetest love, there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love, can't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter
[Verse 2]
Now I'm a climber, this mountain is just one ladder
It gets better every second we're together
Oooh baby it feels so right
A new beginning starts tonight
The reason for when it's on
Is because of you and me and
[Pre-Hook 1]
Sweetest love
Finally I can't believe
Cause you and me, you're my sweetest love
[Hook x2]
[Bridge]
Now I got that feeling in my gut
Now I need your fire in my life
Now I wanna give you love so much
And I keep on feeling my sweet, my sweet
Sweetest love
[Pre-Hook 2]
I can't believe that you and me, we gotta be
You're my sweetest love
[Hook x3]
[Pre-Hook 2]
