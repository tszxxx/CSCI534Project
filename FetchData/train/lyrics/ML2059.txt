[Verse 1]
So you think I'm alone?
But being alone's the only way to be
When you step outside
You spend life fighting for your sanity
[Chorus]
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
[Verse 2]
If you want to be free
Below the ground is the only place to be
Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity
[Chorus]
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
[Bridge]
Bring wings to the weak and bring grace to the strong
May all evil stumble as it flies in the world
All the tribes comes and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night and have faith in love
[Verse 3]
I'm trying to find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?
[Chorus]
But this is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
[Bridge]
This is a cold....
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
Kellindo!
Do you know? It's a cold, cold war...
Do you?
Do you?
Do you..ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
It's a cold, cold
You better know what you're fighting for
[Outro]
Bye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye
Bye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye
Bye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye
Bye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye
