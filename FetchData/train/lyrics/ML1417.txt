[Intro]
I ripped your heart out from your chest
Replaced it with a grenade blast
[Chorus]
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
[Verse 1]
Firefighters hose me down
I don't care I'll burn out anyhow
It's four-alarm
 
girl nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me
You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain
[Chorus]
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
[Verse 2]
The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at your feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery
You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover burning mind
[Chorus]
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
