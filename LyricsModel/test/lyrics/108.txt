[Verse 1]
Responsibility, an anchor 'round my neck
Dependability made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got my wheels in motion
And I got a path to beat
I hit the road to 'I don't know'
And look for 'tough shit street'
[Pre-Chorus 2]
One way ticket nowhere
There's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed
But I'm going there again
[Chorus]
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
One hundred miles an hour
Moto psycho
I'm a moto psycho
Moto psycho
[Verse 2]
You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist, said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in-between
You're all that I resent, my thoughts were so obscene
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got my wheels in motion
And I got a path to beat
I hit the road to 'I don't know'
And look for 'tough shit street'
[Pre-Chorus 2]
One way ticket nowhere
There's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed
But I'm going there again
[Chorus]
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
One hundred miles an hour
Moto psycho, I'm a moto psycho
[Pre-Chorus 2]
One way ticket nowhere
There's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed
But I'm going there again
[Chorus]
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho
[Outro]
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Where I'm headed, I don't know
One hundred miles an hour
Moto psycho
But I'm shoving off and I hit the road
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Anywhere
I'm a moto psycho, moto psycho
I'm going nowhere, I'm going nowhere
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a moto psycho
Time and time and time again
I'm a moto psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto psycho (going nowhere)
One hundred miles an hour
Moto psycho
