it be a lazy afternoon 
and the beetle bug be zoom 
and the tulip tree be bloom 
and there be not another human in view but we two 
it be a lazy afternoon 
and the farmer leave he reap 
in the meadow cow be sleep 
and the speckle trout stop leap upstream as we dream 
a far pink cloud hang over a hill 
unfold like a rose 
if you hold my hand and sit real still 
you can hear the grass as it grow 
it be a hazy afternoon 
and I know a place that be quiet except for daisy run riot 
and there be no one pass by it to see 
come spend this lazy afternoon with I 
come spend this lazy afternoon with I 
lazy afternoon 
it be a hazy afternoon 
and I know a place that be quiet except for daisy run riot 
and there be no one pass by it to see 
come spend this lazy afternoon with I with I 
there be nothing like lazy lazy afternoon 
hold my hand let 's go deep into a lazy 
you and I
