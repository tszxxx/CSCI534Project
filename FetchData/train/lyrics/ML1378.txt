[Verse 1]
It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, "Dear John," and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't
[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
[Verse 2]
So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't
[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't
[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There is your trouble
