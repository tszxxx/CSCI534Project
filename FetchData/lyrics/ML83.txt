[Verse 1]
When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies
[Chorus]
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
Love, love
[Verse 2]
When the garden flowers
Baby are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red
[Chorus]
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
[Verse 3]
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it
[Chorus]
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
[Verse 4]
Tears are running
Down and down and down your breast
And your friends, baby
They treat you like a guest
[Chorus]
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
