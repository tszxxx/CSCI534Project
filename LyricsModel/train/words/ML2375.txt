fuck you and this whole city and everyone in it 
carve name into my skin in candlelight 
see it up with hate 
carve a message in my arm in candlelight 
see it up with hate 
find my misery with a match and gasoline 
burn alive I be a killing machine whole life I be silent 
find my destiny with a match and gasoline 
liar burn and scream a whole life indebt to you 
the silence of pain insane I feel love sick not to hurt 
I want to watch the world burn 
find my misery with a match and gasoline 
burn alive I be a killing machine whole life I be silent 
find my destiny with a match and gasoline 
come back can you hear I scream 
Whole life indebted to you 
the silence of pain insane I feel love sick not to hurt 
I want to watch the world burn 
the silence of pain insane I feel love sick not to hurt 
I want to watch the world burn 
carve name into my skin in candlelight 
see it up with hate 
the silence of pain insane I feel love sick not to hurt 
I want to watch the world burn 
the silence of pain insane I feel love sick not to hurt 
I want to watch the world burn
