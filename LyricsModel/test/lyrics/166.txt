From a whisper in the wind (whisper)
To a loud scream (hey)
The message came that I've lost you
To the warmth of another man
For heaven sakes, girl, don't do this to me
I've seen more tears fall from your eyes
Than all the showers of April
I took kindness for granted
As if it came with the wallpaper
So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there
But, oh my love (you've lost it)
Oh, my love (she's gone)
My love (you've lost it)
(She's long gone)
For heaven sakes, girl, don't do this to me
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
I simply must've been crazy
I must have been out of my mind
To overlook the needs in you
How could I have been so blind
Never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
But now I'm begging, my baby, please, please, please
But oh, my love (you've lost it)
Oh, my love (she's gone)
My love (you've lost it)
So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there
But oh, my love (you've lost it)
Oh, my love (she's gone)
My love (you've lost it)
(She's long gone)
