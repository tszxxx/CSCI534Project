[Verse 1]
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number trouble by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number trouble by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
And the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
