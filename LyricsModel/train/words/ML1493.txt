total nightmare 
total nightmare 
you want to hear my side 
you need to drow to know 
with all the time 
it hurt I to fuck you 
I build a wall with you blood to show 
God save we 
God save we all 
God hate we 
God hate we all 
total nightmare 
total nightmare 
nothing to heal 
no one to break 
pill have a role now there be nothing to take 
nothing to trust 
no one to fake 
you will find out sooner that it be best if we just know we place 
my infiltrate mind 
my lacerate soul 
it take I year create I control you 
I leave myself for a idea I steal 
God save we 
God save we all 
God hate we 
God hate we all 
total nightmare 
total nightmare 
lure rape kill 
love hate fear 
you better take you time 
you better take it slow 
cause when you seek the one 
there be nothing leave to show 
total nightmare 
total nightmare 
total nightmare 
total nightmare
