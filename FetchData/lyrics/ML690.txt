[Verse 1]
It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone
[Chorus]
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
[Verse 2]
It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh, it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh, but when it rains
[Chorus]
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let you fall
[Bridge]
Don't be afraid to fall
I'm right here to catch you
I won't let you down
It won't get you down
You're gonna make it
Yeah, I know you can make it
[Chorus]
'Cause I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
Oh, I'm gonna hold you
And I won't let go
[Outro]
Won't let you go
No I won't
