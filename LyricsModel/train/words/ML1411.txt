I could while away the hour Conferrin ' with the flower Consultin ' with the rain ; well , my head I would be scratchin ' while my thought be busy hatchin ' if I only have a brain I would unravel ev'ry riddle for ev'ry individdle in trouble or in pain with the thought you would be thinkin ' you could be another Lincoln if you only have a brain oh I could tell you why the ocean 's near the shore , I would think of thing I never think before , and then I would sit -- and think some more I would not be just a nuthin ' my head all full of stuffin ' my heart all full of pain ; I would dance and be merry , Life would be a ding - a- derry if I only have a brain .
