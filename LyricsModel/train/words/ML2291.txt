I be not get no horse 
I be not get no horizon 
just the scar on my eye 
I swear I get from crying 
where I be bear it do not matter 
there be not no go back 
I have no home to take you 
I never dream like that 
sit and watch my cigarette smoke on itself 
sit and watch my cigarette smoke on itself 
sit and watch my cigarette smoke on itself 
and I think what the hell hell hell 
I do not want you to like I 
there be no way that you can and 
I do not want you to touch I honey 
I be just so mad 
there be not no kind of feeling 
all my be out 
I be just live and breathe 
for what I steal for myself 
sit and watch my cigarette smoke on itself 
sit and watch my cigarette smoke on itself 
sit and watch my cigarette smoke on itself 
and I think what the hell hell hell
