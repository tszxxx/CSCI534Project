the sky be cry look at the tear roll down the street 
the sky be cry look at the tear roll down the street 
I be wait in tear look for my baby and I wonder where can she be 
I see my baby one morning and she be walk on down the street 
I see my baby one morning yes she walk on down the street 
make I feel so good until my poor heart would skip a beat 
I get a bad feeling my baby my baby do not love I no more 
I get a bad feeling my baby do not love I no more 
now the sky be be cry the tear roll down my door
