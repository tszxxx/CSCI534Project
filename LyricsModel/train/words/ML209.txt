catch up in this madness too blind to see 
wake animal feeling in I 
take over my sense and I lose control 
I will taste you blood tonight 
you know I make you want to scream 
you know I make you want to run from I baby 
but know it be too late you have waste all you time 
yeah 
relax while you be close you eye to I 
so warm as I be set you free 
with you arm by you side there be no struggle 
pleasure be all mine this time 
you know I make you want to scream 
you know I make you want to run from I baby 
but know it be too late you have waste all you time 
cherishing those feeling pleasure 
cover I unwanted clemency 
scream til there be silence 
scream while there be life leave vanishing 
scream from the pleasure unmask you desire 
perish 
we have all have a time where we have lose control 
we have all have we time to grow 
I be hope I be wrong but I know I be right 
I will hunt again one night 
you know I make you want to scream 
you know I make you want to run from I baby 
but know it be too late you have waste all you time 
cherishing those feeling pleasure 
cover I unwanted clemency 
scream til there be silence 
scream while there be life leave vanishing 
scream from the pleasure unmask you desire 
perish 
some live repress they instinctive feeling 
protest the way we be build do not point the blame on I 
scream scream scream the way you would 
if I ravage you body 
scream scream scream the way you would 
if I ravage you mind 
cherishing those feeling pleasure 
cover I unwanted clemency 
scream til there be silence 
scream while there be life leave vanishing 
scream from the pleasure unmask you desire 
perish
