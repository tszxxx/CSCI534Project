rain slap on the window pane 
a hour or more of teeming 
Storm punching like a hurricane 
that tore he out of dreaming 
air scream through the slightest gap 
rattle between the frame and the sill 
drape hang from the final act 
when I have you still 
one lonely bird be sing 
lower the hood hang of he lament 
dash he down on cold cement 
one Bell ringing 
fly buzzing round strip search light 
they have get he down on he knee 
he think of honey drip from a spoon 
girl whisper in portuguese 
between muzzle and the black site 
electrical contact 
deny you name and then carry the blame 
somewhat after the fact
