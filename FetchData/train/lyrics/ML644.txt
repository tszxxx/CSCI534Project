[Intro: Jo Dee Messina]
Ooh
[Verse 1: Jo Dee Messina]
Another day has almost come and gone
Can’t imagine what else could wrong
Sometimes I’d like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war
[Chorus: Jo Dee Messina]
'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
[Verse 2: Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw
]
It’s almost like the hard times circle ‘round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated
I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I’m not dead
[Chorus: Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw
]
'Cause 
tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
[Bridge: Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw
]
No, 
I’m not gonna let it get me down
I’m not gonna cry
And I’m not gonna lose any sleep tonight
[Chorus 2: Jo Dee Messina]
'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I am not afraid
So bring on the rain
[Chorus: Jo Dee Messina 
with Tim McGraw
]
Tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
[Outro: Jo Dee Messina and 
Tim McGraw
 and 
both
]
Ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
No, I'm 
not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
So bring on the rain (
ay-e-ay-e-ain
)
Ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
Bring on the rain (
rain
)
Bring on the rain
Bring on the rain
Ooh
