[Verse 1]
All our monkeys have monkeys
We drive our deathcrush diamond Jaguar limousines
We're not fantastic motherfuckers
But we play them on TV
[Refrain]
It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like
It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like
[Chorus]
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
[Verse 2]
The devils are girls with Van Gogh's missing ear
You say what you want but filth is all that they hear
I've got the jigger to make all of you bigger
Ladies und gentlemen
So, drop your pissroom bait
And make sure you're not late
You tramps and lunatics
Here is a trick that's gonna make you click
[Chorus]
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
[Refrain]
It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like
It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like
[Bridge]
So my Bon Mots, Hit-boy Tommy Trons
Rowdy rowdies, honey-fingered Goodbye Dolls
Hellzapoppin, open your Third Nostril
Put on your black face and your god is gone
[Chorus]
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
[Outro]
We sing la la la la, lala la
We sing la la la la la
We sing la la la la, lala la
We sing la la la la la
