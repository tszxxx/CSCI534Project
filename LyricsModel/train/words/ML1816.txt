C be on say you love I 
C be on say you care 
I see you face in my mind 
I see it everywhere 
I will be you girl 
I will be you girl 
first say I will go 
but I must be wrong 
you make up 's on another 
but never follow 
I will be you girl 
I will be you girl 
you can have my word 
you can have my word 
you can have my word 
I will be you girl 
each day you waste 
on somebody else 
and it be so hard to find 
and I be you kind I be you kind 
I will be you girl 
I will be you girl 
you can have my word 
you can have my word 
you can have my word 
I will be you girl 
you girl you girl you girl 
you girl you girl you girl 
you girl you girl
