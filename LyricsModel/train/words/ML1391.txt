I be up all night long 
just waitin on the sun 
I have give up damn the daw and 
it be not never go to come 
something be wrong 
as long as you go 
I be not go to sleep 
til I touch you face 
baby not a wink 
I could go for day 
if you ever need 
to see I down on my knee 
take a look at I 
baby I can not sleep 
remember when 
you say we would not last 
I could not swallow my pride 
oh it be sinkin in 
baby lose you have 
finally open my eye 
I be wide awake 
as long as it take 
I be not go to sleep 
til I touch you face 
baby not a wink 
I could go for day 
if you ever need 
to see I down on my knee 
take a look at I 
baby I can not sleep 
I be not go to sleep 
til I touch you face 
baby not a wink 
I could go for day 
if you ever need 
to see I down on my knee 
take a look at I 
baby I can not sleep 
til I touch you face 
baby not a wink 
I could go for day 
I be not go to sleep 
til I touch you face 
baby not a wink 
I can not sleep
