[Verse 1]
True in this modern world when two lovers get together
Chances of 'em ever making it to forever
Couldn't be better than two in a million hearts
Girl this ain't just another run of the mill emotion
What I'm feeling is the definition of devotion
My love for you is true
[Chorus]
True, like the sun coming up each morning
Bright as the light in a baby's smile
Sure as a mountain river winding
Right as the rain falling from the sky
Girl my love for you, is true
[Verse 3]
True, not another minute on this Earth can be borrowed
So there's no way to know when I'll live my last tomorrow
But everyday I get, I'll share with you
This feeling just keeps getting stronger as the time goes by
It's written on my face, you can see it in my eyes
My love for you is true
[Chorus][2x]
