[Verse 1]
I will leave behind all of my clothes I wore when I was with you
All I needs my railroad boots and my leather jacket
[Chorus]
As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
 although my heart is breaking
I will steal away out through your blinds for soon you will be waking
[Verse 2]
The morning light has washed your face and everything is turning blue now
Hold on to your pillowcase there's nothing I can do now
[Chorus]
As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
 you'll find another soldier
And I swear to god by Christmas time there'll be someone else to hold you
[Bridge]
The only thing I'm taking is the scarf off of your clothesline
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers and your broken wind chimes
[Chorus]
As I say goodbye I say goodbye I say goodbye to
Ruby's arms
[Verse 3]
I will feel my way down the darkened hall and out into the morning
The hobos at the freight yards have kept their fires burning
So Jesus Christ this goddamn rain will someone put me on a train
I'll never kiss your lips again or break your heart
[Outro]
As I say goodbye I say goodbye I say goodbye to
Ruby's arms
