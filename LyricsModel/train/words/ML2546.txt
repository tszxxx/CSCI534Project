sadness have be close as my next of kin 
then happy come one day chase my blue away 
my life begin when happy smil 
sweet like candy to a child 
stay here and love I just a while 
let sadness see what happy do 
let happy be where Sadness be 
happy that be you 
you make my life brand new 
lose as a little lam be I till you come in 
my life begin when happy smil 
sweet like candy to a child 
stay here and love I just a while 
let sadness see what happy do 
let happy be where Sadness be 
where have I be 
what lifetime be I in 
suspend between time and space 
Lonely until happy come smile up at I 
sadness have no choice but to flee 
I say a prayer so silently 
let Sadness see what happy do 
let happy be where Sadness be 
till now 
happy yeah yeah 
happy oh happy 
happy oh yeah happy
