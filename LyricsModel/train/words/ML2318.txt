if you want to know 
how far to go 
to hell just ask I 
if you want to see 
the view from you knee 
come down and join I 
I be the final straw 
the nail in coffin just by be 
who I be be so goddamn 
I be not the master of the Universe 
I walk the earth the wrong way 
make my pretension and fulfil the worst 
my past be curse the wrong way 
you glass be half 
he glass be full 
my glass be empty 
you be run short 
of not enough 
well I have get plenty 
I have come a long way 
I go the wrong way 
and who I be be so goddamned 
I be not the master of the Universe 
I walk the earth the wrong way 
make my pretension and fulfil the worst 
my past be curse the wrong way 
and when I die I be go to fly 
and come and get you 
and when you try and run 
I will be the curse above you 
it be get to end it be get to end 
in the race for disaster I will come in first 
that be what I have learn the hard way 
if you want to know 
how far to go 
to Hell just ask I 
if you want to see 
the view from you knee 
come down and join I 
I have come a long way 
I go the wrong way
