[Verse 1: Teddy Pendergrass]
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love
Don't leave me this way, no
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
A broken man with empty hands
Baby please, please
Don't leave me this way
[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Free, free
[Verse 2: Teddy Pendergrass]
Don't leave me this way
'Cause it would be wrong
To string along a love so true
Don't leave me this way
Don't you understand I'm at your command
So baby please, please don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive
Can't stay alive
Without your love
Don't leave me this way
[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning, out of control
Now come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
[Bridge: Teddy Pendergrass &amp;
