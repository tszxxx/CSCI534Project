do not go around spread rumour 
even if what you say be true 
before you go and tell you tale 
you better think thing true 
so speak no evil Evil will not happen to you 
I have be mad enough to kill someone 
but I could not face the task 
so I try to shout they down 
with this big mouth of mine 
so speak no evil evil will get you in time 
I have be about that that should not mess with you 
every time that I lie you know I mean to tell the truth 
no matter where I go no matter what I do or say 
somebody go to tell I when they oughtta back away 
word throw out in anger always come back to haunt you 
once they go they tell I talk so hard to undo 
so speak no evil evil will come back to you 
better speak no evil evil will come back to you
