remember when we say goodbye I wipe my tear you do not cry we both say thing we do not mean reach for the hope but catch between the scream and I would try to calm you down but you would not listen and now I find you be not around and it 's you love I be miss louder than love that 's what we be , we be louder than love and we could not make thing better louder than love that 's what we be , we be louder than love and we could not stay together if we could both go back in time back to the day when you be mine we would vow to try but who 's to say that the love we share could ever be the same maybe someday we will both learn just how fragile love be the mind forget but the heart still burn as it long for you kiss louder than love that 's what we be , we be louder than love and we could not make thing better louder than love that 's what we be , we be louder than love and we could not stay together through the thing that we say and the tear that we shed love stay but the word go to far we be both leave with the scar of love now we must go we separate way , my love louder than love that 's what we be , we be louder than love and we could not make thing better louder than love that 's what we be , we be louder than love and we could not stay together
