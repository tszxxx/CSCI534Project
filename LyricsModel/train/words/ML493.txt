let 's get lose 
lose in each other 's arm 
let 's get lose 
let they send out alarm 
and though they will think we rather rude 
let 's tell the world 
we be in that crazy mood 
let 's defrost 
in a romantic mist 
let 's get cross 
off everybody 's list 
to celebrate this night we find each other 
mmm let 's get lose 
let 's defrost 
in a romantic mist 
let 's get cross 
off everybody 's list 
to celebrate this night we find each other 
mmm let 's get lose
