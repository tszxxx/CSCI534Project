over the star in through the hall 
we will go far 
we be in the business 
the freedom line 
we get the patience if you have get the time 
we be in the business 
the liberty rhyme 
we get the wisdom if you have get the mind 
over the star in through the hall 
we will go far 
we be in the business 
the freedom line 
we get the vision if you have get the eye 
we be in the business 
the liberty rhyme 
we get the diamond if you have get the crown 
over the star in through the hall 
we will go far
