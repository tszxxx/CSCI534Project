oh little bird 
oh little bird I want to sing like you 
the whole day through 
oh little bird why can not I be like you 
oh little bird 
oh little bird I want to be that brave 
and never save 
my loving for some other rainy day 
you fly away 
when it be cold and you can not find another way 
but you will sing and you will love until you find a place 
you can stay 
you can stay 
and sing you little heart out till you die day 
I will fly away 
when it be cold and I can not find another way 
I will sing and I will love until I find a place 
I can stay 
I can stay 
and be as bold as you until my die day 
oh little bird 
oh little bird I want to sing like you 
the whole day through 
oh little bird why can not I be like you 
oh little bird 
oh little bird I want to be that brave 
and never save 
my loving for some other rainy day 
oh little bird 
oh little bird now I will kno 'er be blue 
because of you 
oh little bird now I can sing love true
