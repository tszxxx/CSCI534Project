Distant star come in black or red I have see they world inside my head they connect with the fall of man they breathe you in then dive as deep as they can there 's nothing you can do for they they be the force between when the sunlight be arise there 's nothing you can say to he he be in outer heart and the space have be break it 's Broken we love Broken it 's Broken we love Broken be it far away in the Glitter freeze or in we eye every time they meet it 's by the light of the plasma screen we keep switch on all through the night while we sleep there 's nothing you can do for they they be the force between when the sunlight be arise there 's nothing you can say to she I be without a heart and the space have be break it 's Broken we love Broken it 's Broken we love Broken it 's Broken we love Broken it 's Broken we love Broken
