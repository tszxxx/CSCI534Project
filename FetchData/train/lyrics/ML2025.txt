[Verse 1: Melvin Franklin]
Now that it is Christmas time
And if you say you would be mine
It would be Christmas every day
And baby, I'm in love in you
And if you say you love me too
It would be Christmas every day
[Pre-Chorus: Melvin Franklin &amp; 
The Temptations
]
What a lovely Christmas!
Christmas in the winter time
When the snow falls on the ground
I said Christmas, 
Christmas in the summer time
If I had you around
Christmas in the spring time
And baby that ain't all
If I had you to say you love me too
It would be Christmas even in the fall
[Chorus: Melvin Franklin]
I wrote and told Santa Claus I needed you
Because it would Christmas every day
And I would have the Christmas spirit all through the year
It would be Christmas every day
[Bridge: The Temptations &amp; 
Melvin Franklin
]
Christmas every day!
Every day would be Christmas
Christmas every day!
Lady if I had you
Christmas every day!
A Christmas every day
Christmas every day!
[Chorus: Melvin Franklin]
I wrote and told Santa Claus I needed you
Because it would Christmas every day
And I would have that Christmas spirit all though the year;
It would be Christmas every day
[Outro: The Temptations &amp; 
Melvin Franklin
]
Christmas, Christmas in the winter time
When the snow falls on the ground
What a lovely Christmas
Christmas in the summer time
A when it's hot we'll still have fun
A lovely Christmas
Christmas in the spring time!
When the little birdies sing
You got me walking got me talking 'bout Christmas
Christmas in the fall time!
I got that Christmas spirit
Every day, every day!
Christmas every day!
Every day!
Christmas every day!
Every day, every day!
Christmas every day!
