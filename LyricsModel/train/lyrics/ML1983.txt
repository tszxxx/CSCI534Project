[Verse]
He made it come together
Put your hand on me
And I feel it mama
He made a blind man see
Been sleepwalking
An eternity
[Climb]
Whoa yes
[Chorus]
I'm working on a new plain
Working on Sunday Morning
Working on being forgiven
For all that hard livin'
[Verse]
I've been steamrolling
Heading for a crash
Cruise controlling
Blowing right on past
Sleepwalking
Put your hand on me
[Climb]
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
I'm working on a new plain
Working on Sunday morning
Working on being forgiven
For all that hard livin'
[Bridge]
And the only ones [?]
That've been happy to receive [?]
And you hear them call your name
Carryin' a heavy load
Carryin' a heavy load
[Bridge]
When the bullets that protect you
Come raining down on your own head
Your feeling like your almost blind
Carrying a heavy load
Carrying a heavy load
Oh, no
[Verse]
Don't cry mama
Gonna be ok
So sorry
That it went that way
Like a stray sheep
And then you called on me
[Climb]
I can't stand [?]
[Chorus]
I'm working on a new plain
Workin' on a Sunday morning
Workin' on being forgiven
For all that hard livin'
Workin' on a Sunday morning
Workin' on being forgiven
For all that hard livin'
[Outro]
I'm workin' on a new plain
I'm workin' on a new plain
Feel like I'm being forgiven
For all that hard, hard, hard livin'
Hard livin'
