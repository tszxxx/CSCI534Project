My boy Lollipop
You make my heart go giddyup
You are as sweet as candy
You're my sugar dandy
Whoa oh, my boy Lollipop
Never ever leave me
Because it would grieve me
My heart told me so
I love you, I love you, I love you so
But I don't want you to know
I need you, I need you, I need you so
And I'll never let you go
My boy Lollipop
You make my heart go giddyup
You set the world on fire
You are my one desire
Whoa, my Lollipop
I love you, I love you, I love you so
But I don't want you to know
I need you, I need you, I need you so
And I'll never let you go
My boy Lollipop
You make my heart go giddyup
You set the world on fire
You are my one desire
Whoa, my Lollipop
Whoa, my Lollipop
My boy Lollipop
My boy Lollipop
My boy Lollipop
My boy Lollipop
