[Verse 1]
It was a cold California
Even in the summer
She was wrapped in a blanket by the pool
There were rapid statements
About life commitments
A sense of heat that
I couldn't bare to touch
I couldn't bare it
[Chorus]
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
Please stop your crying now
Woah [2x]
[Verse 2]
There was staring and seclusion
A fine tuned way of motion
A face wrapped for a suitor
The sound of hearts pumping at the same beat
Coming 'round the corner
In almost all directions
A sense of heat that
I couldn't bare to touch
No, I couldn't bare it
[Chorus]
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
(It's not your fault so please stop your crying now)
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
(It's not your fault so please stop your crying)
Now you, wait for, something, to cure this
Well I'm here, under your downpour
No, woah
[Outro]
It's not your fault so please stop your crying [2x]
It's not your fault [2x]
So please stop your crying now,[3x]
(No, woah)
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
(No woah, no woah)
(It's not your fault so please stop your crying now)
It's not your fault, stop crying now
(No...)
