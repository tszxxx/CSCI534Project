[Verse]
I'm going to tell ya what it's all about
When you're driving down the highway at night
And you're feeling that 
wild turkey's bite
Don't give 
johnny walker
 a ride
Cause jack black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind
Now just the other night with nothing to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itching for that wonderful feel
Of rolling in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flying while blind
Then they had us up against the wall
Hey it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for driving while blind
