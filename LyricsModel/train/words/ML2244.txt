this can not be love because I feel so well 
no sob no sorrow no sigh 
this can not be love I get no dizzy spell 
my head be not in the sky 
my heart do not stand still just hear it beat 
this be too sweet to be love 
this can not be love because I feel so well 
but still I love to look in you eye 
my heart do not stand still just hear it beat 
this be too sweet to be love 
this can not be love because I feel so well 
but still I love to look in you eye 
I love to look in you eye
