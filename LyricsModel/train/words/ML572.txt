he be up to something 
she be up to something 
and I can not breathe 
4 A.M 
and I be sleep but the phone just ring 
dead air 
and someone breathing who be up to something 
I will leave and let you go 
and though you be move a little too slow 
I will even let you know 
you do the right thing 
he be 
she be 
and I can not breathe and I can not breathe 
4 A.M 
and I be sleep but the phone just ring 
ring 
hello 
dead air 
and someone breathing who be up to something 
I will leave and let you go 
and though you be move a little too slow 
I will even let you know 
you do the right thing 
ring 
hello
