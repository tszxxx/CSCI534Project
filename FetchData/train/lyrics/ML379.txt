[Chorus]
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
[Verse 1]
You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me, and take my hand
When the lights go out you'll understand
[Chorus]
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
[Verse 2]
Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go up you'll understand
[Chorus]
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain
[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That you're wounded
You know, you know, you know, you know (you know)
That I'm here to save you
You know, you know, you know, you know (you know)
I'm always here for you
I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That you'll thank me later
[Chorus]
Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain
