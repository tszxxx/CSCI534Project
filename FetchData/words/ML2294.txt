something 's wrong wrap up in mourn for far too long Sunken eye trace the pavement and crook line paint we with cross and sleepless night and hope to be free we just want to be free hope to be free who 's go to set we free ? Overgrown all we mistake be decieve we have sewn be it time ? I see the stone roll back they eye holding they breath until they see the light it ought to be free we just want to be free we just want to be free who 's go to set we free ? with we golden hair in silent sway we will be home when brother find he way with we golden hair in silent sway we will be home when brother find he way with we golden hair in silent sway we will be home when brother find he way with we golden hair in silent sway we will be home when brother find he way with we golden hair in silent sway we will be home when brother find he way
