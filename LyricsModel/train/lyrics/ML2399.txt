[Pre-Chorus]
Could've been like before
Could've had to lock the door
[Chorus]
Make your mind
Let the door, let the door swing
Only one
Only one to let the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Wanted to pretend he's dead
Didn't have to pretend
[Chorus]
Make your mind
Let the door, let the door swing
Only one
Only one to let the door
[Post-Chorus]
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes me drown
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me know if it's alright
Let me know if you just might
[Chorus]
Make your mind
Let the door, let the door swing
Only one
Only one to let the door
[Post-Chorus]
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes me drown
