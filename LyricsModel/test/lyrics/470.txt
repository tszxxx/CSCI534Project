[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then
[Verse 2]
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind
[Verse 3]
Knock and the door shall be opened
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine
[Verse 4]
I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
