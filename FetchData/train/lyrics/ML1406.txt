[Verse 1]
I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
And I think that I'm beginning to know her
Let it go
I'll be there when you call
[Chorus]
And whenever I fall at your feet
You let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
[Verse 2]
You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
The words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Know
I'll be waiting when you call
[Chorus]
Hey, whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
[Verse 3]
The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help?
Who knows where that might lead
I fall
[Outro]
Whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I fall (at your feet)
Whenever I fall
