[Verse 1]
My life is such a waste
Begging for something to work this time
But why can't I relate?
Feeling all I do is get what's mine
Holding on to faith
Never gave me nothing, but despair
So why do I create
Just to be swallowed?
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take!
(We have a start!)
I can't take!
(We got a fantasy!)
Come what may!
(We are the stars!)
I can't wait!
(I'll take what's mine!)
[Chorus]
Been hating all this time
Before I crawled inside!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
Been hating all this time
Too far to cross the line!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
[Verse 2]
I cannot take this place
Burning up inside this space of mine
So why can't I replace
Feelings I find hard to really find?
I try, but I can't taste
Memories they always fuck with me
So why do I create?
Just to be swallowed
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take!
(We have a start!)
I can't take!
(We got a fantasy!)
Come what may!
(We are the stars!)
I can't wait!
(I'll take what's mine!)
[Chorus]
Been hating all this time
Before I crawled inside!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
Been hating all this time
Too far to cross the line!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
[Refrain]
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
[Bridge]
All my feelings have been eating all of me!
Feeling tired
Is there something wrong with me?
[Chorus]
Been hating all this time
Before I crawled inside!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
Been hating all this time
Too far to cross the line!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
[Outro]
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
Find!
