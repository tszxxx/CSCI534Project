I once know a girl 
in the year of my youth 
with eye like the summer 
all beauty and truth 
in the morning I fly 
leave a note and it read 
someday you will be love 
I can not pretend that I feel any regret 
cause each broken heart will eventually mend 
as the blood run red down the needle and thread 
someday you will be love 
you will be love you will be love 
like you never have know and 
and the memory of I will seem more like bad dream 
just a series of blur like I never occur 
someday you will be love 
you may feel alone 
when you be fall asleep 
every time tear roll down you cheek 
but I know you heart belong 
to someone you have yet to meet 
someday you will be love 
you will be love you will be love 
like you never have know and 
and the memory of I will seem more like bad dream 
just a series of blur like I never occur 
someday you will be love 
you will be love you will be love 
like you never have know and 
and the memory of I will seem more like bad dream 
just a series of blur like I never occur 
someday you will be love 
someday you will be love
