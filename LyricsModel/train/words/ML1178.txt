it feel like a lifetime 
a thousand day have pass by 
since I hold you close to I 
if I could see that smile from my friend 
I know that I could live again 
I need you here with I 
Heaven know what to say 
even though for right 
now you be so far away 
I hope and I pray 
somewhere in you heart I will always stay 
girl lately my sun do not shine without you 
never notice what it feel like to be without you 
feel like I take my last step 
and my last breath in my life end 
have to say just what I be feel girl 
cause my sun do not shine 
Sun do not shine without you 
this be more for I than for you 
girl I finally see there be no substitute 
for what we have 
do you know how much I love you 
and what we share I can not forget 
girl a love like yours I will never let just slip away 
just promise that you will stay 
Heaven know what to say 
even though for right now you be so far away 
gonna tell you and show you 
do whatever I can do to get back to you 
girl lately my sun do not shine without you 
never notice what it feel like to be without you 
feel like I take my last step 
and my last breath in my life end 
have to say just what I be feel girl 
cause my sun do not shine 
Sun do not shine 
have you ever see a flower that never bloom 
see a starless night without the moon 
well that be I without you 
so come back and turn my night into day 
girl lately my sun do not shine without you 
never notice what it feel like to be without you 
feel like I take my last step 
and my last breath in my life end 
have to say just what I be feel girl 
cause my sun do not shine 
Sun do not shine without you
