I keep hear this medley in my ear 
I keep feel he presence so near 
music so sweet so rich and complete 
like the voice of a angel 
it minsiter to I 
chorus 
a love song 
beautiful song 
a love song 
sweet simple song 
could it be a dream or be it reality 
sound just like a symphony 
music so sweet so rich and complete 
like the voice of a angel 
it minister to I 
chorus 
a love song 
beautiful song 
a love song 
sweet simple song 
Guitar play 
the day he open my eye 
and he change my heart 
Jesus be the love song he be the love song 
love song 
too I 
Jesus be a love song love song 
Jesus be a love song
