Happy Birthday to You
Happy birthday, Jesus
I'm so glad it's Christmas
All the tinsel and lights
And the presents are nice
But the real gift is You

All the carols and bells
Make the holiday swell
And it's all about You
Happy birthday, Jesus
Jesus I love You

All the carols and bells
Make the holiday swell
And it's all about You
Happy birthday, Jesus
Jesus I love You
