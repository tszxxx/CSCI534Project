young love teacher 's pet 
cheek flush apple red 
ringe you every day 
beg for a word of praise 
I have put aside my foolish game 
I run and hide and callin name 
school be out the bell will ring 
now be the time to teach I everything 
teacher teacher teach I love 
I can not learn it fast enough 
teacher teacher teach I more 
I have get to learn to love for sure 
lesson one just begin 
Grow up be not much fun 
grow up out of school 
out of luck and out of rule 
no one there to tell I how 
a different world teacher teach I now 
teacher teacher teach I love 
I can not learn it fast enough 
teacher teacher teach I more 
I have get to learn to love for sure 
lesson two nothing new 
I can not love just pass through 
book I read do not understand 
what it mean to be a man 
I need a woman just like you 
teacher teacher teach I what to do 
teacher teacher teach I love 
I can not learn it fast enough 
teacher teacher teach I more 
I have get to learn to love for sure 
teacher teacher teach I love 
I can not learn it fast enough 
teacher teacher teach I more 
I have get to learn to love for sure 
teacher teacher teach I love 
I can not learn it fast enough
