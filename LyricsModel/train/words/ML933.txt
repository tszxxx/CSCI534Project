after work I and the boy 
go down to Killey 's and we make some noise 
feed that old jukebox and play some air guitar 
well and there be nothin wrong with shootin pool 
and have some fun and act a fool 
but this time I will not be go where they be 
cause I be go home and rock my baby 
just thinkin bout she be make I crazy 
and all day long I have be dreamin of hold she tight 
yeah it be go to be a sweet surrender 
candlelight and love I tender 
I be go home and rock my baby tonight 
the girl sure have be work hard 
I thank she be ready for some R n' R 
something to take she mind off everything 
Champagne and a box of candy 
a dozen rose might come in handy 
to help loose up those apron string 
cause I be go home and rock my baby 
just thinkin bout she be make I crazy 
all day long I have be dreamin of hold she tight 
yeah it be go to be a sweet surrender 
candlelight and love I tender 
I be go home and rock my baby tonight 
if the rose and the candy do the trick 
tomorrow I may have to call in sick 
cause I be go home and rock my baby 
just thinkin bout she be make I crazy 
and all day long I have be dreamin of hold she tight 
yeah it be go to be a sweet surrender 
candlelight and love I tender 
I be go home and rock my baby tonight 
yeah I be go home and rock my baby tonight
