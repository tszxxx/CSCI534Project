another lonely night I think if I be lucky i will get into a fight I hate everything I see it 's a different city with the same old scene a waste of space then what a suprise through the dull conversation and glaze over eye there you be in all you glory I could tell that you would not bore I oh I I hate people but I I like you oh I I hate people and you you do too I be walk around want to die think I would not make it through the night if I try but I see you stand there in you tear leather jacket and dark brown hair you be different from all the rest my eye see only yours and that big mess as I push past the people to get to you I see in you eye that you already know oh I I hate people but I I like you oh I I hate people and you you do too I think that we could get together I think that we could have some fun just the two of we Alone together hate everyone ! oh I I hate people but I I like you oh I I hate people and you you do too
