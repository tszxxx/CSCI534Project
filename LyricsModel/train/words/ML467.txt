I see you eye 
and you make I smile 
for a little while 
I be fall in love 
I see you eye 
and you touch my mind 
although it take a while 
I be fall in love 
I see you eye 
and you make I cry 
and for a little while 
I be fall in love 
I be fall in love 
fall in love 
fall in love 
fall in love 
fall in love
