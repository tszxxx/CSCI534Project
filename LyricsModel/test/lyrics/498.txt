[Verse 1]
I don't want to kiss you; I don't want to touch
I don't want to see you 'cause I don't miss you that much
I'm not a telephone junkie
I told you that we were just good friends
But when I hold you like I hold that Bakelite in my hands
[Chorus]
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
Every time I phone you, I just want to put you down
[Verse 2]
He's got the keys to the car; they are the keys to the kingdom
He's got everything you need; it's a shame that he didn't bring them
I'm not a telephone junkie
If I'm inserting my coin, I'm doing just fine
Then the things in my head start hurting my mind
And I think about the way things used to be
Knowing you're with him is driving me crazy
Sometimes, I phone you when I know you're not lonely
But I always disconnect it in time
[Chorus]
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
Every time I phone you, I just want to put you...
Every time I phone you, I just want to put you...
Every time I phone you, I just want to put you down
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
Every time I phone you, I just want to put you down
