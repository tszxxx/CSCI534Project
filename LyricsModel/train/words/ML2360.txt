I be a child 
who want love that be wild 
though tight as slow motion 
but crazed with devotion 
insane with devotion 
a whole other notion 
I be fourteen and a half 
and it be not no laugh 
love come in spurt oh no it hurt 
love come in spurt it hurt 
love come in spurt oh no cause 
love come in spurt it always hurt 
I just can not get wise 
to those tragical lie 
though I now know the fact 
they still cut like a axe 
cause love come in spurt 
in dangerous flirt 
and it murder you heart 
they do not tell you that part 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt 
love come in spurt
