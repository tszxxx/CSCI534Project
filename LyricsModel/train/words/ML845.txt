take I into the seas 
so I can clean off this disease 
death will complete I 
it be what I need 
Ya! 
take my evil to the sky 
take my evil all light die 
shatter the Skies above 
I want to destroy all that you love 
shatter the Skies above 
I will not rest 'til I be drench in blood 
take I into the seas 
so I can clean off this disease 
death will complete I 
it be what I need 
shatter the Skies above 
shatter the Skies
