I would have to be crazy to stop all my sing and never play music again you would call I a fool if I grab up the top hat and run out to flag down the wind I would have to be weird to grow I a beard just to see what the redneck would do but I would have to be crazy plum out of my mind to fall out of love with you I know I have do weird thing I tell people I hear thing when silence be all abound be day when it pleased I to be on my knee follow ant as they crawl across the ground be insane on a train but I be still I again in a place where I hold you be true so I know I be alright cause I would have to be crazy to fall out of love with you you know I and I do not intend to but should there come a day when I say that I do not love you you can lock I away ay ay I sure would be dingy to live in a envelope wait along for a stamp you would swear I be loco to rub for a genie while burn my hand on the lamp and I may not be normal but nobody be so I would like to say before I be through I would have to be crazy plum out of my mind to fall out of love with you I would have to be crazy plum out of my mind to fall out of love with you
