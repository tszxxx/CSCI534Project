there be a Christmas tree 
in a window frame 
just inside my door 
but my Christmas tree 
do not look the same 
as it always have before 
there be just one lonely present 
beneath my Christmas tree 
cause the best little present 
a girl ever have 
have go away from I 
oh my Christmas tree be not very big 
in fact it be kind of small 
Honey go he pick them out 
they always seem so tall 
the light do not seem so bright this year 
it be hard for I to see 
the smile that make my Christmas bright 
be go away from I 
I have be so lonely 
since you leave I all alone 
all I want for Christmas be 
my baby back at home 
oh my Christmas tree be so sad and bare 
my room be so big and cold 
they wish I happy new year 
but the new year be already on 
there be no little angel 
on top where it use to be 
cause the angel 
that make my Christmas right 
have go away from I 
cause the angel 
that make my Christmas right 
have go away from I 
cause the angel 
that make my Christmas right 
have go away from I
