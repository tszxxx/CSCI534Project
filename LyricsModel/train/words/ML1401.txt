here we be like we be go to get war again 
come hard come and get a gun join the gang 
with the bang bang and the same song we sang 
come over and over again 
it be pick up now get more like a game 
and it feel real like we learn to fake the fame 
and there be never more then one truth 
but u can always tell you better half 
always tell you better half of the story 
it go well with the better side of you face u show on tv 
give I a good reason why I should not start a revolution 
what be in the constitution be this illusion that we buy 
you cut the wing and then you say fly 
you say the hero be the one that die 
but 
the true hero be the one who do not live a lie and understand 
that there be a end out of the cycle 
who be the master who be the disciple 
you can do what you can but will you do it again 
so what be the plan 
look like we be go to get war again 
here we be like we be go to get war again 
come hard come and get a gun join the gang 
with the bang bang and the same song we sang 
come over and over again 
it be pick up now get more like a game 
and it feel real like we learn to fake the fame 
and there be never more then one truth 
but you can always tell you better half 
look out 
go to get war again go to get wrong again 
go again with the same song again on again 
can not be bear again who be go again 
who be go to gain out of this war again 
hooligan in a tie rule again 
soon again u will see it all begin again 
sink again and that will make you think again 
and when they call you go 
when they be wrong you know 
and you will fallow and you will swallow 
again like long ago the bomb will blow 
so sit back 
relax and enjoy the show 
cuz you be as cold as snow and I be here below 
I be go to speak out scream out 
here we go get the fresh flow 
so before it be over 
then you be go to find a different kind of war to start again 
go to get war again
