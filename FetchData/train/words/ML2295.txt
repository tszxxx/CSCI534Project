seek out the darkness , welcome wretchedness submerge in hatred , blasphemy , and death desire the fire , become evil 's flame Allegiance to the unlord , kill and kill again within the darkness , all be consume Inclined to madness , chaos , and doom overflow evil , bound by wickedness with unholy eye of the serpent , void of righteousness dead be the world I live in , evil be the air I breath where the light have fail , darkness now prevail
