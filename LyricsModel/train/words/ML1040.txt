that be the way shellshock 
hold on it be never enough 
it be never enough until you heart stop beat 
the deeper you get the sweeter the pain 
do not give up the game until you heart stop beat 
you call I on the phone you leave I all alone 
all I get from you be shellshock 
another day go by and all I do be cry 
all I get from you be shellshock 
I would tell the world and save my soul 
but rain fall down and I feel cold 
a cold that sleep within my heart 
it tear the Earth and sun apart 
but that be the way I can win 
a victim of you evil sin 
you have lose the hold you have have on I 
by cause the change that you never see 
hold on it be never enough 
it be never enough until you heart stop beat 
the deeper you get the sweeter the pain 
do not give up the game until you heart stop beat 
when we walk through open doorway 
count time in one or more way 
we can not find we peace of mind 
and life become a life of crime 
and that be the day I call you name 
I come to you I call in vain 
you lose the faith within you heart 
the fire in you soul from the end to the start 
hold on it be never enough 
it be never enough until you heart stop beat 
the deeper you get the sweeter the pain 
do not give up the game until you heart stop beat 
I have be good and I have be bad 
but common sense I have never have 
no matter how I try and try 
I hide the truth behind a lie 
but that be the way that I can win 
a victim of you evil sin 
you lose the faith within you heart 
the fire in you soul from the end to the start 
hold on it be never enough 
it be never enough until you heart stop beat 
the deeper you get the sweeter the pain 
do not give up the game until you heart stop beat
