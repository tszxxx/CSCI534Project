too unafraid of what be to come 
I hit the ground and run 
not sure what be come next 
and never look back 
hollow night to empty day 
something have to change 
before it get too late and there be no turn back 
one by one we fit and then we fall 
one by one we fit and then we fall 
Lonely be this what we have become 
so lonely fragile and unloved 
lose inside ourselves and blindly stare at the sun 
so lonely be this what we have become 
line they up they fall 
something to live for 
not sure who be come next 
but never look back 
I want something more 
something to live for 
before it get too late and there be no turn back 
one by one we fit and then we fall 
one by one we fit and then we fall 
Lonely be this what we have become 
so lonely fragile and unloved 
lose inside ourselves and blindly stare at the sun 
so lonely be this what we have become 
one by one we fit and then we fall 
one by one we fit and then we fall 
Lonely be this what we have become 
so lonely fragile and unloved 
lose inside ourselves and blindly stare at the sun 
so lonely be this what we have become 
be this what we have become 
so lonely fragile and unloved 
lose inside ourselves and blindly stare at the sun 
so lonely be this what we have become
