Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet
Went to the corner of second and main
And there was someone there who mentioned that they hoped
That it would rain forever, forever
So they could drown in peace
(Well I) Went down to the hodskin p.l
But there was nobody to answer when I rang
The doorbell forever, forever so now I'm sad all the time
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet
Today was the day but she threw it all away
And I could never understand
Cause she was never one to play by the rules of the game
Her and me we're so the same
(And I) I try so hard and I never give in
And I am never satisifed until the day that I win against them
But I don't care I'll follow her to anywhere
(
But I don't care, I can fade away to anywhere-
Don't stop cause you might get dropped
)
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet (X3)
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet
