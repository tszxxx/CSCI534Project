there be blood on the gun 
that be in you hand 
and the murder in front of you 
send out the wolf 
the king be dead 
little pill take over 
this mean war 
do the sun just burn out 
leave you all alone 
live in a wicked world 
we be live in a wicked world 
there be no way you will escape 
no one ever get away 
love be the fuel 
that drive you sin 
when the Majesty follow you 
the witch dance 
the night begin 
and the heart 's take over 
the royalty will not wash away 
it be he scent that be inside of you 
off with she head 
the Queen she scream 
little pill take over 
this mean war 
do the sun just burn out 
leave you all alone 
live in a wicked world 
we be live in a wicked world 
there be no way you will escape 
no one ever get away 
live in a wicked world 
we be live in a wicked world 
it be a wicked world 
will someone save I 
save I 
somebody save I 
somebody save I
