if I should stay 
well I would only be in you way 
and so I will go but yet I know 
that I will think of you each step of my way 
and I will always love you 
bitter sweet memory 
that be all I have and all I be take with I 
good bye oh please do not cry 
cause we both know that I be not 
what you need 
and I hope life will treat you kind 
and I hope that you have all 
that you ever dream of 
oh I do wish you joy 
and I wish you happiness 
but above all this 
I wish you love 
I love you I will always love 
I I will always always love you
