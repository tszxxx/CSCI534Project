fear and panic in the air I want to be free from desolation and despair and I feel like everything I sow be be sweep away well I refuse to let you go I can not get it right get it right since I meet you loneliness be over when will this loneliness be over ? Life will flash before my eye so scatter and lose I want to touch the other side and no one think they be to blame why can not we see that when we bleed we bleed the same ? I can not get it right get it right since I meet you loneliness be over when will this loneliness be over ? loneliness be over when will this loneliness be over ?
