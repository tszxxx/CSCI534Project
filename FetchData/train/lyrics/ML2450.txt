[Verse 1]
Why boasteth thyself
Oh, he-vil man
Playing smart
And not being clever, oh no
I said you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity yeah, if a-so a-so
But the goodness of Jah-Jah
I-dureth for-i-ver
[Chorus]
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down (Well sharp)
Ready to cut you down, oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
These are the words
Of my master, keep on telling me, oh
No weak heart shall prosper, oh no they can't, eh, eh
[Bridge]
Whosoever diggeth a pit, lord
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it
[Chorus]
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down
[Bridge]
Eh, whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it, eh
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it
[Chorus]
If you have a big tree
We have a small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down, oh
[Outro]
If you are the big tree, let me tell you this
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down, oh, yeah
