and bird will not soar the sky and there will be no sun to shine 
no country win a war the grass will not grow the same 
the moon will not shine at night and there be a lose fight

if you hear a bomb be head you way 
where would you go what would you bring 
if you hear a bomb be head you way 
now what would you do what would you say 
if you hear a rocket be head you way 
where would you go what would you bring 
no soldier win a war see soldier only die 
and mama only cry just for a conscious flag to fly 
that be why nobody win a war no war be worth you life 
see that be a priceless pride no war be worth you blood 
nobody win a war 
now what would you do what would you say 
if you hear a bomb be head you way 
where would you go what would you bring 
if you hear a bomb be head you way 
now what would you do what would you say 
if you hear a rocket be head you way 
where would you go what would you bring 
tell I who would you pray to 
now what would you do what would you say 
if you hear a bomb be head you way 
where would you go what would you bring 
if you hear a bomb be head you way 
now what would you do what would you say 
if you hear a rocket be head you way 
where would you go what would you bring

we the people speak speak 
we want to be free of this sick bureaucracy 
no more death toll with we morning coffee 
oh government you have lose you feeling for life 
it be war that you reap 
but the loss be too great and the pain be too deep 
the scar do not heal 
you system be thoughtless and you vision be weak 
you action be hurtful 
you never find what you seek 
you make the sky a storm 
you destroy the earth make possibility bleak 
you lie be you destruction you justice stink 
you pride be maniacal you be the bearer of grief 
you win be shallow you truth be oblique 
you patriotism be garbage it rot and it reek 
of death in the wind the foul stench of I and 
bask in they cruelty rejoice in they sin 
you give up and give over so easily to the darker side 
because of you pride you risk all of humanity 
you send my child to murder human being 
family they do not yet know people they have never see 
you send my child to war 
without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat 
a equal understanding as if there be not even a possibility for peace 
but there be always a possibility for peace 
as un perfect as we be we should in all way reach 
deep deep down in we being 
oh this wicked wicked system of thing 
as we grandmother say 
will soon be no more will soon be no more 
because nobody no one ever win a war
