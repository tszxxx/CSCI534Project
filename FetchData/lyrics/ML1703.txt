[Verse 1]
Still by the window pane
Pain like the rain that's falling
[Chorus]
She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America
[Verse 2]
When, when was the night so long
Long like the notes I'm sending
[Guitar Solo (original version only)]
[Chorus]
She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America
She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America
