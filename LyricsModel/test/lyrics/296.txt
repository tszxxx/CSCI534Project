I'd have to be crazy
To stop all my singing
And never play music again
You'd call me a fool
If I grabbed up the top hat
And ran out to flag down the wind
I'd have to be weird
To grow me a beard
Just to see what the rednecks would do
But I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you
I know I've done weird things
I told people I heard things
When silence was all abounds
Been days when it pleased me
To be on my knees
Following ants
As they crawl across the ground
Been insane on a train
But I'm still me again
In a place where I hold you is true
So I know I'm alright
Cause I'd have to be crazy
To fall out of love with you
You know I
And I don't intend to
But should there come a day
When I say that I don't love you
You can lock me away ay ay
I sure would be dingy
To live in an envelope
Waiting along for a stamp
You'd swear I was loco
To rub for a genie
While burning my hand on the lamp
And I may not be normal
But nobody is
So I'd like to say before I'm through
I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you
I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you
