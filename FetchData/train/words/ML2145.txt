there 's no way to write it , there 's no way to fight it and I kick and scream but you get I despite it and I get my pride so I begin to hide it like fire in Freetown you begin to light it Aha ha Aha ha , sidii hogasha roobka Aha ha Aha ha , you shine down upon I Aha ha Aha ha , sidii hogasha roobka Aha ha Aha ha , you shine down upon I by some higher order , you keep get bolder by God or by country you kill like a soldier by some riddle you sung little , but scream mighty stronger like fire in Freetown , you old magic spoiler you place pin in my rib and ask I to lie down my pain be you pleasure but pleasure be all mine you lend I you false ear , I will lend you my false line like fire in Freetown , I be fuel by you gold mine Fire fire ! Fire fire , she pull out she match and she burn down my home Fire fire , she always can find I , she know where I roam Fire fire , she know where to touch I to turn I to stone Fire fire , she come like a storm and she rain on my lawn Fire fire , she know where to touch I to rune I to stone Fire fire , she always can find I , she know where I roam Fire fire , she pull out she match and she burn down my home
