I will have a blue Christmas without you 
I will be so blue just thinkin about you 
decoration of red on a green Christmas tree 
will not be the same dear if you be not here with I 
and when the blue snowflake start fallin 
that be when the blue memory start callin 
you will be doin alright with you Christmas of white 
and I will have a blue blue Christmas 
you will be doin alright with you Christmas of white 
and I will have a blue blue Christmas 
and I will have a blue blue Christmas 
and I will have a blue blue Christmas
