I will be come home 
just to be alone 
cause I know you be not there 
and I know that you do not care 
I can hardly wait 
to leave this place 
no matter how hard I try 
you be never satisfied 
this be not we home 
I think I be better off alone 
you always disappear 
even when you be here 
this be not my home 
I think I be better of alone 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a home 
by the time you come home 
I be already stoned 
you turn off the tv 
and you scream at I 
I can hardly wait 
til you get off my case 
no matter how hard I try 
you be never satisfied 
this be not we home 
I think I be better off alone 
you always disappear 
even when you be here 
this be not my home 
I think I be better of alone 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a home 
I be better off alone 
no matter how hard I try 
you be never satisfied 
this be not we home 
I think I be better off alone 
you always disappear 
even when you be here 
this be not my home 
I think I be better of alone 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a 
Home home 
this house be not a home
