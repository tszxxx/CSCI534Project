I will never bother you 
I will never promise to 
I will never follow you 
I will never bother you 
never speak a word again 
I will crawl away for good 
I will move away from here 
you will not be afraid of fear 
no thought be put into this 
and always know it would come to this 
thing have never be so swell 
I have never fail to fail 
He- eee- eee-eeey 
he eee eee- eey 
He- eee- eee-ey 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
I be so warm and calm inside 
I no longer have to hide 
let 's talk about someone else 
steam soup against she mouth 
nothing really bother she 
she just want to love himself 
I will move away from here 
you will not be afraid of fear 
no thought be put into this 
always know it would come to this 
thing have never be so swell 
I have never fail to fail 
he eee eee- eey 
he eee eee- eey 
he eee eee- eey 
he eee eee- eey 
he eee eee- eey 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you be right 
you know you rights 
you know you rights 
you know you rights
