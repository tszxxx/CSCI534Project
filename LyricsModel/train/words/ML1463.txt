there be a hole in the wall 
with a light shine in 
and it be let I know to get up 
it be time to begin 
oh there be nothing to lose 
cause it be already lose 
in a runaway world 
of confusion 
I be go to take it 
that be why I fight fire with fire 
oh I be burn inside and my heart be a-cryin 
Fire with fire 
I do not want to lose this flamin desire 
stand alone 
in a crowded room 
I can feel a chill in the air 
I be shakin 
I be mile away 
I want to cry out loud 
I want to fight till the end 
I will not let them take I alive 
and you know I will fight fire with fire 
oh I be burn inside and my heart be a-cryin 
Fire with fire 
cause I be never go to lose this flamin desire
