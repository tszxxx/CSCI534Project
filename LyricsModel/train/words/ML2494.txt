how do you know what you can be 
if you can not see where you be go 
what break the silence 
misery can make you see where you belong 
it be a dangerous stage but the show must go on 
why do you lie why do you lie 
would you betray you soul 
why do you lie why do you lie 
do not let you weakness show 
you just might be the last to know 
freedom be such a load word 
so full of hurt and such aplomb 
loneliness saunter in its breeze 
like a disease it drag along 
the time of you life can not be have for a song 
why do you lie why do you lie 
would you betray you soul 
why do you lie why do you lie 
do not let you weakness show 
you just might be the last to know 
why do you lie why do you lie 
would you betray you soul 
why do you lie why do you lie 
do not let you weakness show 
why do you lie why do you lie 
only the meek follow 
why do you lie why do you lie 
trample the fear below 
you might just be the last to know
