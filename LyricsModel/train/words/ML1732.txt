Crystal river 
get a woman on the other side 
Crystal river 
get a woman on the other side 
and nothin can touch I here 
nothin can touch I here 
nothin can touch I here 
on crystal river 
I love she 
I swear by the diamond sky 
I love she 
I swear by the diamond sky 
and nothin can touch I here 
and nothin can touch I here 
and nothin can touch I here 
on crystal river 
I be dreamin 
dreamin where the water 's wide 
Crystal river 
get a woman on the other side 
and nothin can touch I here 
nothin can touch I here 
no nothin can touch I here 
on crystal river 
she be sleep 
sleep by the waterside 
she be sleep 
out there on that bank she lie 
and nothin can touch I here 
nothin can touch I here 
no nothin can touch I here 
on crystal river
