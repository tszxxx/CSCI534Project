Do me wrong, do me right
Tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
But dont let me be lonely tonight
Say goodbye and say hello
Sure enough good to see you, but its time to go
Dont say yes but please dont say no
I dont want to be lonely tonight
Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please
You ain't gonna see me gettin down on my knees
Im undecided, and your hearts been divided
Youve been turning my world upside down
Do me wrong, do me right (right now baby)
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light (morning light)
But dont let me be lonely tonight
I dont want to be lonely tonight
No, no, I dont want to be lonely tonight
I dont want to be lonely tonight
