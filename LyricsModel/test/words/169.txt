if you be travelin ' the north country fair where the wind hit heavy on the borderline remember I to one who life there for she once be a true love of mine if you go when the snowflake storm when the river freeze and summer end please see if she have a coat so warm to keep she from the howling wind please see if she hair hang long if it roll and flow all down she breast please see for I if she hair 's hangin ' long for that 's the way I remember she best I be a-wondering if she remember I at all many time I have often pray in the darkness of my night in the brightness of my day so if you be travelin ' the north country fair where the wind hit heavy on the borderline remember I to one who life there for she once be a true love of mine
