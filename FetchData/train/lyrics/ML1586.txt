This is a test
Sugar, sugar, boo boo
What do you know about love
It's just a test
It ain't your life
Tell me...
Talk about love
That's all I want you to do
I'd like to give you a test
So, darling, prepare yourself
When I say love please explain
What pictures pop in your brain
'Cause when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
Say when you think about love (Love, love, love)
Ooo, when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
You should be talking 'bout me (Love, love, love)
Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an afterthought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good lovin' will be gone
So let's erase any doubt
Take a second or two to figure out
Speak from your lips to my ears
Yes, I know you know what I want to hear
When you talk about love (Love, love, love)
Hey, when you think about love (Love, love, love)
Ooo, when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
You should be talkin' 'bout me (Love, love, love)
No, I'm not gonna play tit for tat
When it comes to affairs of the heart
But if I love you I won't look back
And I know that I love you so just do your part
When you talk about love (Love, love, love)
I said, when you think about love (Love, love, love)
When you talk about love (Love, love, love)
You should be talking 'bout me (Love, love, love)
So when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
Ooo, when you think about love (Love, love, love)
So when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
You should be talking 'bout me (Love, love, love)
Ooh, I said, say my name
(Patti, Patti!)
That's right
Said, say my name
(Patti, Patti!)
Said, say my name
(Patti, Patti!)
What's my name?
My name is love, love, love (Patti, Patti!)
I'm tellin' you
Said, love in the morning (Love, love, love)
I said, it's love in the afternoon (Love, love, love)
I'll give you good love in the evening, baby (Love, love, love)
Oh, that's my name (Love, love, love)
Oh, my name is love (Love, love, love)
My name is love (Love, love, love)
My name is love (Love, love, love)
My name is love (Love, love, love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
