I hear music 
mighty fine music 
the murmur of a morning breeze up there 
the rattle of the milkman on the stair 
sure that be music 
mighty fine music 
the singing of a sparrow in the sky 
the perking of the coffee right near by 
that be my favorite melody 
you my angel phone I 
I hear music 
mighty fine music 
and anytime I think my world be wrong 
I get I out of bed and sing this song
