some people they call I crazy 
for fall in love with you 
they can take I and lock I away baby 
cause there be nothing those bar can do 
I will be the rise moon after the setting sun 
just to let you know you will always have someone 
I will be the clearest day when the rain be do 
so you will always know 
through the shake of a earthquake I will never fall 
that be how strong my love be 
like a ship through the storm we can risk it all 
that be how strong my love be 
I use to feel kinda lonely 
cause the world it can be so fake 
all that matter I be tell you be you and I only 
and the fortress from love we make 
I will be the water you need in the desert land 
just to let you know you will always have my hand 
I will be the woman you need to be a better man 
so you will always know 
through the shake of a earthquake I will never fall 
that be how strong my love be 
like a ship through the storm we can risk it all 
that be how strong my love be 
oh can not nothing break we down 
oh cause we be heaven bound 
like the mountain stand tall 
immovable we be here to stay 
oh can not nothing get in the way 
through the shake of a earthquake I will never fall 
that be how strong my love be 
like a ship through the storm we can risk it all 
that be how strong my love be 
through the deepest water 
I will not let you drow 
that be how strong my love be 
cause we be the moon in the sky 
that will never come down 
that be how strong my love be 
that be how strong my love be 
that be how strong my love be
