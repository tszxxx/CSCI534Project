and so it be 
just like you say it would be 
life go easy on I 
most of the time 
and so it be 
the shorter story 
no love no glory 
no hero in she sky 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye 
and so it be 
just like you say it should be 
we will both forget the breeze 
most of the time 
and so it be 
the colder water 
the blower 's daughter 
the pupil in denial 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
I can not take my eye off of you 
oh do I say 
that I loathe you 
do I say that I want to 
leave it all behind 
I can not take my mind off of you 
I can not take my mind off of you 
I can not take my mind off of you 
I can not take my mind off of you 
I can not take my mind off of you 
I can not take my mind off of you 
my mind 
my mind 
till I find somebody new
