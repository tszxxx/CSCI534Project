[Verse 1]
Hardly waiting 'til the bed was warm
You closed your eyes and said, "I'm feeling torn"
How could I be so unendingly forced into this course
[Chorus]
Sad, I feel sad
For you, so sad
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
From the heart, when he doesn't come home
[Verse 2]
Softly sighs my Nightingale
Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale
He sings shifting from side to side
Can't make up his god-given mind, no
Why don't you just go
If she's waiting
[Chorus]
Whoa, oh honey, I am telling you, you better think about it
[Chorus x2]
