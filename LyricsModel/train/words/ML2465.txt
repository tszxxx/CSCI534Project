and lay you crazy pave from end to end to end to end

oh wild horse be run through you eye of blue 
loneliness only make I high

loneliness only make I high 
loneliness only make I want to hold on 
I want to take you there have the time of you life 
I be go to lift you up to where the drink be free to the 
party in the sky

loneliness only make I high 
loneliness only make I want to hold on 
to a good thing that be go bad 
and I be build my house on sand 
do not get I wrong I want to be you friend 
and lay you crazy pave from end to end to end to end 
I have hear you stupid story I know that some be true 
oh wild horse be run through you eye of blue 
loneliness only make I high 
loneliness only make I want to hold on 
loneliness only make I high 
loneliness only make I want to hold on 
to a good thing that be go bad 
and I be build my house on sand
