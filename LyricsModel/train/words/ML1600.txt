it be a cold California 
even in the summer 
she be wrap in a blanket by the pool 
there be rapid statement 
about life commitment 
a sense of heat that 
I could not bear to touch 
I could not bear it 
it be not you fault so please stop you crying now 
it be not you fault so please stop you crying now 
please stop you crying now 
woah 
there be stare and seclusion 
a fine tune way of motion 
a face wrap for a suitor 
the sound of heart pump at the same beat 
come round the corner 
in almost all direction 
a sense of heat that 
I could not bear to touch 
no I could not bear it 
it be not you fault so please stop you crying now 
it be not you fault so please stop you crying now 
now you wait for something to cure this 
well I be here under you downpour 
no woah 
it be not you fault so please stop you crying 
it be not you fault 
so please stop you crying now 
it be not you fault so please stop you crying now 
it be not you fault stop cry now
