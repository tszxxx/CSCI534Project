[Verse 1]
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do
[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry, and I pray, and I beg
[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
[Verse 2]
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go
[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry, and I pray, and I beg
[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
(Anything but you)
[Outro]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
I know that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
