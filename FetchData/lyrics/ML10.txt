You haffi get a slam from a real ghetto gyal (Again)
Gimme the gyal dem with the wickedest slam
The kinda gyal weh know how fi love up she man

Man, if you never get a pedal and wheel
And if you've never had your banana peeled
Man, if you haffi know how good loving feel
You haffi find a gyal weh live at Maxfield!
Man, if you love your girlfriend to your heart
But you nah get the slam weh you want
Whole heap of things can gwan if you hide
Go look a Junglist girl pon the side

The kinda gyal weh know how fi love up she man

Gyal inna bed and she nuh know what to do
But me nah go wrinkle and screw
Because me done have mi gyal at Seaview
Me nah go run go get no uptown girl
True she brown and she pretty like pearl
True me know a mama man run the world
You coulda find out your girl's named Earl
Man, if you have a ghetto girl, unuh fi proud!
Although she might-a look kinda loud
But when it comes down to who run the road
A ghetto girl dem a move with the crowd
So!
[Chorus]
Gimme the girl dem with the wickedest slam
The kinda gyal weh know how fi love up she man
Man, if you waan fi get the medal
You haffi get a slam from a real ghetto gyal (Again)
Gimme the gyal dem with the wickedest slam
The kinda gyal weh know how fi love up she man
Man, if you waan fi get the medal
You haffi get a slam from a real ghetto gyal (Man!)
[Verse 1]
If you never get a pedal and wheel
And if you've never had your banana peeled
You waan fi know how good loving feel
You haffi find a gyal weh live at Maxfield!
Man, if you love your girlfriend to your heart
But you nah get the slam weh you want
Whole heap of things can gwan if you hide
Go look a Junglist girl pon the side
So!
[Chorus]
A ghetto gyal dem a the wickedest slam
The kinda gyal weh know how fi love up she man
Man, if you waan fi get the medal
You haffi get a slam from a real ghetto gyal...
