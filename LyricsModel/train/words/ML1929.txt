death until the dust and we be wait 
ruin in the rust of we craving 
it feel like it feel like 
do not you know the cost of you betrayal 
you be the one that be lose you be go to fail 
it feel like it feel like you be gasp with all you might 
you can not take away my strength 
fix these broken vein 
there be nothing leave to fight 
you can not take away my pride I will not be deny 
there be nothing leave to fight 
insect walk below I be on a wire 
Fire will burn below but I be higher 
it feel like it feel like 
do not you know the cost of you betrayal 
you be the one that be lose you be go to fail 
it feel like it feel like you be gasp with all you might 
you can not take away my strength 
fix these broken vein 
there be nothing leave to fight 
you can not take away my pride I will not be deny 
there be nothing leave to fight 
do you remember how 
you become who you be now 
do you remember how 
it feel to breathe without 
gasp with all you might 
you can not take away my strength 
fix these broken vein 
nothing leave to fight 
you can not take away my strength 
fix these broken vein 
there be nothing leave to fight 
you can not take away my pride I will not be deny 
there be nothing leave to fight 
nothing leave to fight 
live free or let I die 
nothing leave to fight 
live free or let I die 
nothing leave to fight 
live free or let I die
