sit there and count you finger 
what can you do 
old girl you be through 
sit there and count you little finger 
unlucky little girl blue 
sit there and count the raindrop 
fall on you 
it be time you know 
all you can count on be the raindrop 
that fall on little girl blue 
no use old girl 
you may as well surrender 
you hope be get slender 
why will not somebody send a tender blue boy 
to cheer up little girl blue 
when I be very young 
the world be younger than I 
as merry as a carousel 
the circus tent be string with every star in the sky 
above the ring I love so well 
now the young world have grow old 
go be the tinsel and gold 
all you can count on be the raindrop
