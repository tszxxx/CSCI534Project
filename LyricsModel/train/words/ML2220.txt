the sound of Christmas fill the air the shout of girl and boy 
the silver bell and all the noel make a joyful night 
but once the choir quiet down and sing they last amen 
what happen then what happen then 
if you hold you breath and listen 
you might finally find what you world be be miss 
peace heavenly peace 
in between you own heart 's beating 
there be a quiet voice that keep repeat 
peace heavenly peace 
and it be all about peace can be find on a mountain top or a avenue 
in the silent night in the light of day in the way I feel when I be with you 
I do not need satin ball and tissue 
not to wrap the gift that I want to wish you peace 
I wish you peace heavenly peace 
like the warming glow of the morning sun 
there be enough for everyone 
in the precious time we be give and 
what I would not give if we could only live in peace 
I wish you peace let there be peace 
glorious peace heavenly peace 
may you blessing multiply may you bounty never cease 
and may you sleep in heavenly peace
