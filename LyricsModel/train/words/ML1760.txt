it be hard for I to say what I want from 
you I have have 22 year of 
try to form the word that somehow 
might mean I be feel 
so many color in this distraction 
Brown hair make she lip more red 
word would not describe what I be see 
I try to hold my tongue but it be useless 
she make my heart scream color 
I know by now she should have find I out 
and every sense I have be be exhaust 
but color make she smile 
she be always wait for I to speak 
but all she hear be whitest noise 
though I may not communicate my heart 
she know the color I be scream 
she make my heart scream color 
I know by now she should have find I out 
and every sense I have be be exhaust 
but color make she smile 
I feel it come I feel it come 
I feel it come I feel it come 
I feel it come I feel it come 
I feel it come on 
whoa she make my heart scream color 
I know by now she should have find I out 
and every sense I have be be exhaust 
but color make she smile 
yeah she make my heart scream color 
she should have find I out 
and every sense I have be be exhaust 
but color make she smile
