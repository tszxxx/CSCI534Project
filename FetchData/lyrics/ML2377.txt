He wants some angry young men
Ones who can't be bought
Ones who will not run from a fight
Ones who speak the truth whether it's popular or not
Ones who will give up anything to walk in His light
Rest assured, when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for some angry young men
He wants some angry young men with fire in their eyes
Ones who understand what Jesus gave
Ones who have grown weary of the world and all its lives
Ones who won't forget they've been delivered from the grave
Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll come back for the angry young men
Yes, He will
They say if you don't you cry
I say if you don't live, you'll die
Well the road to hell is paved with some impressive alibis
But unless you thirst for Jesus first
Man, heaven will pass you by
You'll be tempted, tried, and tested
There'll be wars the devil wins
But God's love is not a license
To lie there in your sins
He understands the human heart
His mercy is complete
But His grace was not intended
As a place to wipe your feet
Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for some angry young men
Who love the Lord they serve
Ones who'll do much more than make a speech
Ones who act their faith out with the passion it deserves
Cause if we cannot live it, tell me who are we to preach?
Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll come back for the angry young men
Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for the angry young men
He'll be looking, yes He will
