[Verse 1]
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down
[Refrain 1]
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
[Verse 2]
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be
[Refrain 2]
Oh, Ruby
I still need some company
[Verse 3]
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age, Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
[Refrain 1]
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
[Verse 3]
She's leavin' now cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
[Refrain 1]
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
[Refrain 3]
Oh Ruby
For God sake's turn around
