all my little plan and scheme 
lose like some forget dream 
seem that all I really be do 
be wait for you 
just like little girl and boy 
play with they little toy 
seem like all they really be do 
be wait for love 
do not need to be alone 
no need to be alone 
it be real love 
it be real 
yes it be real love 
it be real 
from this moment on I know 
exactly where my life will go 
seem that all I really be do 
be wait for love 
do not need to be afraid 
no need to be afraid 
it be real love 
it be real 
yes it be real love 
it be real 
think I would be in love before 
but in my heart I want more 
seem like all I really be do 
be wait for you 
do not need to be alone 
do not need to be alone 
it be real love it be real 
it be real love it be real 
yes it be real love it be real 
it be real love it be real 
yes it be real love it be real 
it be real love it be real 
yes it be real love it be real 
it be real love it be real
