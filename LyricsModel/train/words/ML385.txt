I be so sick of you so sick of I 
I do not want to be with you 
I be so sick of you so sick of I 
I do not want to be with you 
I want to fly away 
I want to fly away 
I be so sick of work so sick of play 
I do not need another day 
I be so sick of work so sick of play 
I do not need another day 
I need a hideaway 
I need a hideaway yeah 
oh 
hey hey hey 
oh 
every shiny toy that at first bring you joy 
will always start to cloy and annoy 
every camera every phone all the music that you own 
will not change the fact you be all alone 
every piece of land every city that you plan 
will crumble into tiny grain of sand 
everything you find that at first seem to shine 
always turn into the same old grind 
I want to fly away 
I want to fly away 
I be so sick of you so sick of I 
I do not want to be with you 
I be so sick of you so sick of I 
I do not want to be with you 
every little dance every internet romance 
all alone 
all alone 
I be so sick of you so sick of I 
I do not want to be with you
