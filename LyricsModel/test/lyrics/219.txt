[Verse 1]
Ain't getting old
Ain't getting younger though
Just getting used
To the lay of the land
I ain't tongue-tied
Just don't got nothing to say
I'm proud to be living in the U.S.A
[Chorus]
Ready to go, willing to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A
So my sweet love can dance
Another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A
[Verse 2]
In history we painted pictures grim
The devil knows
We might feel that way again
The big wind blows
So the tall grass bends
But for you don't
Push too hard my friend
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Got people here
Down on their knees and praying
Hawks and doves
Are circling in the rain
Got rock and roll
Got country music playing
If you hate us, you just
Don't know what you're saying
[Chorus]
Ready to go, willing to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A
So my sweet love can dance
Another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A
