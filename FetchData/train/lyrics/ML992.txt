[Verse 1]
You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil
[Chorus]
But I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
[Verse 2]
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to Stillwater
And ride a pack of dogs
[Chorus]
But I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
[Verse 3]
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining icepicks on your steel shore
[Chorus]
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
I'm going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
