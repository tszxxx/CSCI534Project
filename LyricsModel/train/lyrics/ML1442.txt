Sometimes we rock and roll
Sometimes we stay at home and it's just fine
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
I am my mother's hen
And left the body in the bed all day
We don't know what to do
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
A thousand made-up loves
What makes the sound of surf once you know you're alive?
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
And you're my favorite thing
Tell it everywhere I go
I don't know what to do
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
Sometimes we rock and roll
I'd rather stay at home and build a life
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
