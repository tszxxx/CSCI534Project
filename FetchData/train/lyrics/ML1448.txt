[Chorus]
A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each other's arms
It was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you
And whispered in my ear
Let's spend the night together
Sharing love beyond the bed
[Pre-Chorus]
As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share
And the music stopped
In a flash I was all alone
It was just a dream
Haunting me once again
[Chorus]
A dream
A simple fantasy (Simple fantasy)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
[Verse 2]
The day you left
You said you would return
Just when you couldn't promise
That you needed some time alone
You said you'd love me
And someday our love would be
I couldn't understand it
I thought we were both happy
[Pre-Chorus]
As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share
Then the music stopped
In a flash I was all alone
It was just a dream
Haunting me once again, oh
[Chorus]
A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
(Relive this dream once more)
A dream
A simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
(Oh, oh oh)
Oh, a dream
A simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you (You, you, you)
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
A dream
