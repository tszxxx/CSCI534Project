I want to have a party 
I want to have a party 
I want to have a party 
I want to have a party 
you can not kill the party 
you can not kill the party 
you can not kill the party 
long live the party 
do you care what you be 
where be you pride 
we do not know 
but we do not wonder why 
the conquest will survive 
the more that you can give it then the more it will be 
and if you do not have it you can take it from I 
all we ever want be a thing to believe 
and now that we have find it we have all that we need 
we have find we pride
