by the light of the moon I be comin home 
Howlin all the way I be comin home 
on my hand and knee I be comin home 
I know when I have be beat yea I be comin home 
by the skin of my tooth I be comin home 
by the sole of my foot you know I be comin home 
I be comin home but I be not comin for you 
I be ride out the wind I be comin home 
it do not matter where I have be I be comin home 
Crawlin on all four I be comin home 
turnin brick wall into door I be comin home 
I have get the taste in my mouth 
I have get a hunger in my gut 
my skin have turn to leather 
my hair be band rope 
my knee have buckle beneath the weight of doubt 
but now I miss thing that I have do without 
I be comin home 
but I be not comin home for you 
I be comin home 
be not nothin you can do about it 
be not nothin you can do about it 
do not leave the light on 
do not need you anymore my old friend 
put a cross above the door 
lay up the board 
I be on my way 
I be comin home 
I be comin home 
I be comin home 
I be comin home 
I be comin home
