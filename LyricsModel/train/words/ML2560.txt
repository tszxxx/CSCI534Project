again we stalk the stage 
at mach speed we engage 
feed people 's rage 
the big cat 's leave it be cage 
back in the bus again 
to catch another plane 
this behaviour be quite insane 
but we do it for the fame 
I lose my mind I lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
I lose my mind I lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
the road will never end 
it always start again 
another show be around the bend 
another long lose friend oh 
faceless as the snow 
there be nothing special about the road 
it be just another haul 
it be just too damn long that be all 
I lose my mind I lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
I lose my mind I lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
lose my mind I lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
I lose my mind lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
I lose my mind lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road 
I lose my mind lose all my money 
I lose my life to the killing road
