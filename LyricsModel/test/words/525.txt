from the time I fall asleep ' Til the mornin ' come I dream about you , baby and I feel alright ' cause I know tonight I will be with you , baby and who make I feel like smilin' when the weary day be through ? they say candy be sweet but it just can not compete with you , baby you have get everything I need and nobody can please like you do , baby and who believe all my wildest dream and my craziest scheme will come true ? a little ray of sunshine a little bit of soul add just a touch of magic you get the greatest thing since rock ' n' roll
