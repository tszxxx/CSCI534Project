When we laugh indoors, the blissful tones bounce off the walls and fall to the ground
Peel the hardwood back to let them loose from decades trapped and listen so still
This city is my home, construction noise all day long
And gutter punks are bumming change
So I breed thicker skin and let my lustrous coat fill in
And I'll never admit that I loved you Guinevere
I loved you Guinevere
I loved you
I've always fallen fast with too much trust in the promise that
No one's ever been here, so you can quell those wet fears
I want purity, I must have it here right now
But don't you get me started now
December's chill comes late, the days get darker and we wait for this direness to pass
There are piles on the floor of artifacts from dresser drawers and I'll help you pack
I loved you Guinevere
I loved you Guinevere
I loved you
