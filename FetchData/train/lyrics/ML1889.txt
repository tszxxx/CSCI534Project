[Verse 1]
We can be like they are
We can be free
We can be like they are
We can be free
Free to be evil
Free to believe
Free to be slaves now
To this silver machine
[Chorus]
Can it help us
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
[Verse 2]
We can be like they are
We can be free
We can be like they are
We can be free
Free to eat the fruit
From the evil tree
Free to be one now
With this silver machine
[Chorus]
