hold my hand 
I need you now 
slow I down 
I do not know how

I need you now 
slow I down 
I do not know how 
be you live the feeling 
the hight be they worth seek 
nothing like believe 
be you drug healing 
hold my hand 
I need you now 
slow I down 
I do not know how 
hold my hand 
I need you now 
slow I down 
I do not know how 
be you really live 
or do you seek loving 
be you happy be 
or do you search for meaning 
be you ever ask 
question they need answer 
you be not really hear 
you really need release 
a million piece break 
a million secret unspoken 
a million piece break 
a million secret unspoken 
hold my hand 
I need you now 
slow I down 
I do not know how 
hold my hand 
I need you now 
slow I down 
I do not know how 
secret everywhere
