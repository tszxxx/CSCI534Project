One, two, ready, go
Grow some big feet, holes in history
Is where you'll find me, is where you'll find
All is love, is love, is love, is love
L-O-V-E, it's a mystery
Where you'll find me, where you'll find
All is love, is love, is love, is love
All is love
One, two, ready, go
L-O-V-E, it's a mystery
Where you'll find me, where you'll find
All is love, is love, is love, is love
All is love
All is love, is love, is love, is love
