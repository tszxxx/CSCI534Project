[Verse 1]
I've been with 9s and 
10s
Some come around again
I've seen a dime or two
They don't compare to you
So many things I like
Too many to even name
I wanna be your man
I hope you feel the same
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, all I wanna do is hold you
And show you how much I adore you
Want you
Need you
Baby
[Chorus]
You're, you're my favorite girl
Baby, you're the only one
I wanna give you the world, yeah
You're, you're my favorite girl
You really really got it goin' on
Everything that a man could ever want
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
[Verse 2]
Girl, no more playing games
I'm done with other dames
I figure what's the use?
There's really no excuse
Many good qualities, I can't think of one complaint
That's why you're number one, and all the others ain't
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, all I wanna do is hold you
And show you how much I adore you
Want you
Need you
Baby
[Chorus]
You're, you're my favorite girl
Baby, you're the only one
I wanna give you the world, yeah
You're, you're my favorite girl
You really really got it goin' on
Everything that a man could ever want
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
[Bridge]
You're everything a man like me could ever want
Give me want I need and nothing that I don't
Girl, I promise I will always have your back
You're all I need
[Chorus]
You're, you're my favorite girl
Baby, you're the only one
I wanna give you the world, yeah
You're, you're my favorite girl
You really really got it goin' on
Everything that a man could ever want
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
[Chorus]
You're, you're my favorite girl
Baby, you're the only one
I wanna give you the world, yeah
You're, you're my favorite girl
You really really got it goin' on
Everything that a man could ever want
You're my favorite girl
[Outro]
(Favorite girl)
You're my favorite girl
(You're my favorite
Girl)
You're my favorite...
