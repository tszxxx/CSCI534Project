[Verse 1]
If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine
[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
[Verse 2]
If you got bad news
You want to kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
[Bridge]
[Verse 3]
If your day is gone
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine
[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
