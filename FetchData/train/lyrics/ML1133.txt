The Moon beams we can dream on, And the working day is done
And the stars we can wish upon, At the setting of the sun
The Sunsets we could cry over, have our trouble's on the run
But more than these miracles above, good people, we got love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above
And nobody ever found happiness, living their life all alone
I used to go around like I didn't need nobody, to be me happy and alone
And one sad day I found myself in trouble, way down without a friend
Along came the love of a real good woman, said she'd love me 'til the end
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above
Everybody  needs love, love, love
Everybody  needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above
Everybody, everybody everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
