can not understand 
why we treat each other in this way 
take up time 
with the silly silly game we play 
we have get we love 
and no matter how it be say or do 
we be one no matter what we do 
we be one we love will see we through 
we be one and that be the way it be 
we be one 
sometimes I feel 
that we try and make each other sad 
I do not know why 
the thing we do 
how we make each other feel so bad 
we have get so much 
we could all be have so much fun 
we be one from the very start 
we be one deep down in you heart 
we be one 
and that be the way it be 
we be one 
I can not understand 
why we treat each other in this way 
take up time 
with the silly silly game we play play 
we have get we love we love 
and no matter how it be say or do 
we be one 
we be one 
you can not get away 
we be one 
we be one 
that be the way it be 
that be the way it be 
we be one 
we be one
