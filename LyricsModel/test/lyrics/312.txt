(Composed by George Gay)
I'm leaning on a lamp, maybe you think, I look a tramp
Or you may think I'm hanging 'round to steal a motor-car
But no I'm not a crook, And if you think, that's what I look
I'll tell you why I'm here, And what my motives are
(Tempo Change)
I'm leaning on a lamp-post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by
Oh me, oh my, I hope the little lady comes by
I don't know if she'll get away, She doesn't always get away
But anyhow I know that she'll try
Oh me, oh my, I hope the little lady comes by
There's no other girl I would wait for, But this one I'd break any date
For
I won't have to ask what she's late for, She wouldn't have to leave me
Flat
She's not a girl like that
Oh, she's absolutely wonderful, and marvellous and beautiful
And anyone can understand why
I'm leaning on a lamp-post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady passes by
(Tempo change)
I'm leaning on a lamp-post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by
Oh me, oh my, I hope the little lady goes do do do dah dah dee dee dee.....
I don't know if she'll get away, She doesn't always get away
But anyhow I know that she'll try
Oh me, oh my, I hope the little lady comes by
There's no other girl I would wait for, But this one I'd break any date
For
I won't have to ask what she's late for, She wouldn't have to leave me
Flat
She's not a girl like that
Oh, she's absolutely wonderful, and marvellous and beautiful
And anyone can understand why
I'm leaning on a lamp-post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady passes by
