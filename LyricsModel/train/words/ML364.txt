well I lose my heart on the day we meet 
but I gain a lot that I do not regret 
then I hang around till you say I do 
I know I would not have nothin if I do not have you 
well it change my thinking when you change you name 
and neither one of we will ever be the same 
and I swear I be never go to be untrue 
cause I would not have nothin if I do not have you 
if I do not have you I would long ago be leave in the dark out in the cold 
blow around from town to town like a feather in the wind 
if I do not have you I know I would be founder around like a ship at sea 
lose in the rain of a hurricane and that be where I would have be 
but I do not get lose cause I see you light 
shine like a beacon on a cold dark night 
and the sun come up and the sky turn blue 
no I would not have nothing if I do not have you 
well I count my blessing every night I pray 
that the Lord let I keep you just one more day 
and every day he do cause God know too 
that I would not have nothing if I do not have you 
if I do not have you I would long ago be leave in the dark out in the cold 
blow around from town to town like a feather in the wind 
if I do not have you I know I would be flounder around like a ship at sea 
lose in the rain of a hurricane and that be where I would have be 
but I do not get lose cause I see you light 
shine like a beacon on cold dark night 
and the sun come up and the sky turn blue 
no I would not have nothing if I do not have you 
well I have already say it but I swear it be true 
I know I would not have nothing if I do not have you
