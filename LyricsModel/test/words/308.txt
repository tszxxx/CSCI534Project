if I live and breathe before you love I , I do not recall if I walk around at all , it be in bit and piece of a jag heart you kiss I and every piece go back in place every pain get erase you hold I up to the sunlight now it feel like no one ever leave I out in the rain Cold word still remain unspoken and I never get lose , spend year in the dark you be here , now my heart 's unbroken when I see you smile fill my soul again I be unbroken if I doubt the power of love , baby now I understand I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch of you magic hand in this world sometimes the only thing that 's real be the way you make I feel Babe , the change day and night I swear it 's life no one ever leave I out in the rain Cold word still remain unspoken and I never get lose , spend year in the dark you be here , now my heart 's unbroken when I see you smile fill my soul again I be unbroken I still see the night , I fall into you eye and when we make love it feel like the first time no one ever leave I out in the rain Cold word still remain unspoken and I never get lose , spend year in the dark you be here , now my heart 's unbroken when I see you smile fill my soul again I be unbroken I be unbroken I be unbroken no one ever leave I out in the rain Cold word still remain unspoken and I never get lose , spend year in the dark you be here , now my heart 's unbroken no one ever leave I out in the rain Cold word still remain unspoken I never get lose , spend year in the dark you be here , now my heart 's unbroken no one ever leave I out in the rain Cold word still remain unspoken ...
