she be like a little bird 
she fly from a to B 
to see what she can see 
she be far away from I 
we dance on the moon 
we dance by the sea 
the land of blue gold 
be where we be free 
July ly- ly 
July ly- ly 
July ly- ly 
where we be free 
where we be free 
the shiny blackest crow 
fly in to say hello 
though much to she surprise 
he have two mouth for eye 
she understand he word 
that crow be very pleased 
he give to she he wing 
and now she be free 
July ly- ly 
July ly- ly 
July ly- ly 
now we be free 
now we be free 
July ly- ly 
July ly- ly 
July ly- ly
