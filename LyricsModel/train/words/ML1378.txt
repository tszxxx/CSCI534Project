it should have be different but it be not different be the 
same old story dear John and so long 
it should have fit like a glove it should have fit like a ring 
like a diamond ring a token of true love 
should have all work out but it do not 
she should be here now but she be not 
there be you trouble there be you trouble 
you keep seein double with the wrong one 
and you can not see I love you you can not see she do not 
but you just keep holdin on 
there be you trouble 
so now you be thinkin' bout all you be missin how 
deep you be sinkin round and round and draggin down 
why do not you cash in you chip why do not you call it a loss 
not such a big loss chalk it up to better luck 
could have be true love but it be not 
it should all add up but it do not 
there be you trouble there be you trouble 
you keep seein double with the wrong one 
you can not see I love you you can not see she do not 
but you just keep holdin on 
there be you trouble 
should have all work out but it do not 
she should be here now but she be not 
there be you trouble there be you trouble 
you keep seein double with the wrong one 
and you can not see I love you you can not see she do not 
but you just keep holdin on 
there be you trouble 
there be you trouble 
there be you trouble 
there be you trouble 
there be you trouble
