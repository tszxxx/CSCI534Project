recite it over a hip hop beat 
I be have trouble say what I mean 
with dead poet and drum machine

but I could not find the killa hook 
now you have go and raise the bar right up

the curtain pull away 
no hyperbole to hide behind 
my naked soul exposé

tryna write a classic 
Wastebin full of paper
