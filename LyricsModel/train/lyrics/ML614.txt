[Verse 1]
Open the door and come in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
I don't know how long it has been
Having those feelings again
[Pre-Chorus]
And now I see that you're so happy
And ooh, it just sets me free
And I'd like to see us as good of friends
As we used to be
Ah....My love...Ah
[Chorus]
You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know that you're not in love with me
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love...
[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That you're never coming back for me
I've had this dream that you'd always be by my side
Oh, I could've died
[Pre-Chorus]
But now I see that you're so happy
And ooh, it just sets me free
And I'd like to see us as good of friends
As we used to be
Ah....My love...Ah
[Chorus]
You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know that you're not in love with me
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that you're in love
I can let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love...
[Bridge]
I tried to find you but you were so far away
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me
Someday, someday, someday...
Ooh, You're In Love
[Outro]
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love...No
No, No, No, No, No, No, No.. Ooh...
