I have go blind but it be all right 
cause my spec give I perfect sight 
and in a second I can see it all 
everything become delightful 
I be not afraid of the dark or noise 
I be not daunt by the bark of boy 
I be with the bird fly in blue sky 
feathery free and I be feel fine 
this city be a golden gate 
the kind of gold that I love to hate 
how good it get in the hype and stress 
even though it be all a well light mess 
bury bury bury better plant it in the ground 
true or false with the lose and find 
hurry bury I up to my knee 
I will swing my branch better in the breeze 
mental mammoth I know I have a very bad habit 
of fill up my cup halfway elephantasize my eye 
vision still untrained in see what I have gain 
a simple remedy of walk into tree 
mistake bird as bee 
mistake thing I see 
bury bury better plant it in the ground 
true or false with the lose and find 
bury bury better plant it in the ground 
true or false with the lose and find 
hurry bury I over my head 
level with the living level with the dead 
bury bury better plant you foot down 
the true and false of you lose and find
