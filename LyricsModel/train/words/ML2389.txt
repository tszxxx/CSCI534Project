I know you want to leave 
be holdin on to you 
beggin you to play this game 
you have already will and 
I do not hate to beg you for you empty arm 
if that be all I can get 
hurt I one more night 
just pretend you love I 
I hill show you happiness I will prove you need my love 
and I hill bend over backwards to tell you every word you want to hear 
whatever you might need to reconsider what I be give say the word 
hurt I one more night 
just pretend you love I 
I hill guess I have do 
all I can do it be really true 
I be lose in you it s over 
if you would change you devil mind 
I hill even let you be more unkind if you want to 
I m fallin on my knee 
I know you be get closer 
to the door that open you world 
and all that make I colder 
if you could spear another chance to dance you 
and lock I in you arm 
abuse I one more night 
and pretend you love I
