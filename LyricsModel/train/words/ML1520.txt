everyday she take a morning bath she wet she hair 
wrap a towel around she as she be head for the bedroom chair 
it be just another day 
slip into stocking step into shoe 
dip in the pocket of she raincoat 
it be just another day 
at the office where the papers grow she take a break 
drink another coffee and she find it hard to stay awake 
it be just another day 
Du du du du du du it be just another day 
Du du du du du du it be just another day 
so sad so sad 
sometimes she feel so sad 
alone in she apartment she would dwell 
till the man of she dream come to break the spell 
stay do not stand around 
and he come and he stay but he leave the next day 
so sad 
sometimes she feel so sad 
as she post another letter to the sound of five 
people gather around she and she find it hard to stay alive 
it be just another day 
Du du du du du du it be just another day 
Du du du du du du it be just another day 
so sad so sad 
sometimes she feel so sad 
alone in she apartment she would dwell 
till the man of she dream come to break the spell 
stay do not stand around 
and he come and he stay but he leave the next day 
so sad 
sometimes she feel so sad 
everyday she take a morning bath she wet she hair 
wrap a towel around she as she be head for the bedroom chair 
it be just another day 
slip into stocking step into shoe 
dip in the pocket of she raincoat 
it be just another day 
Du du du du du du it be just another day 
Du du du du du du it be just another day
