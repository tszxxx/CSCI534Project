Shiny gun, shiny gun, shiny gun right now
It's time for the showdown
I never want to hold the gun without the glove's upon my
Hand, don't leave the finger prints on the murder
Weapon
One of them come i'm gonna kill them dead, two of them
Come i'm gonna run them red, went out to chase i'll send
Them to their beds, another one dead
Shiny gun, shiny gun, shiny gun rude boy
Shiny gun, shiny gun, shiny gun right now
Watch i got my Glock on my waist
Watch i got my Glock on my waist
You want to get acquainted to Betsy or you want to meet
My Glock Charlie.(repeat)
Shiny gun, shiny gun, shiny gun right now
Shiny gun, shiny gun it's time for the showdown
