my past will not stop haunt I 
in this prison there be a fight between 
who I be and who I use to be 
this thorn in my side be a grace 
for because of it the flesh and blood of God 
be offer in my place my place 
you fight the fight in I 
you chase I down and finish the race 
I be blind but now I see 
Jesus you keep the faith in I 
where do my best friend go 
in my defense they disappear 
just like you friend do to you oh Lord 
but you be there you give I strength 
so this little one might come to know 
the glory of you name you name 
you fight the fight in I 
you chase I down and finish the race 
I be blind but now I see 
Jesus you keep the faith in I 
await set apart like incense to you heart 
a libation I be pour out 
empty and beautiful beautiful beautiful 
you fight the fight in I 
you chase I down and finish the race 
I be blind but now I see 
Jesus you keep the faith in I 
you fight the fight in I 
you chase I down and finish the race 
I be blind but now I see 
Jesus you keep the faith in I 
Jesus you keep the faith in I 
savior you keep the faith in I
