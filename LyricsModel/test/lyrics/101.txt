[Verse 1]
I am the entertainer, and I know just where I stand
Another serenader in another long-haired band
Today, I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
And I won't be here in another year if I don't stay on the charts
[Verse 2]
I am the entertainer, and I've had to pay my price
The things I did not know at first I learned by doin' twice
Ah, but still they come to haunt me
Still they want their say
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants
Let 'em rub my neck, and I write 'em a check
And they go their merry way
[Verse 3]
I am the entertainer
Been all around the world
I've played all kinds of palaces, and laid all kinds of girls
I can't remember faces
I don't remember names
Ah, but what the hell, you know it's just as well
Cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same
[Verse 4]
I am the entertainer
I bring to you my songs
I'd like to spend a day or two, but I can't stay that long
No, I've got to meet expenses
I got to stay in line
Gotta get those fees to the agencies
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
So I just don't have the time
[Verse 5]
I am the entertainer, I come to do my show
You've heard my latest record
It's been on the radio
Ah, it took me years to write it
They were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 3:05
[Verse 6]
I am the entertainer
The idol of my age
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage
Ah, you've seen me in the papers
I've been in the magazines
But if I go cold, I won't get sold
I'll get put in the back in the discount rack
Like another can of beans
[Verse 1]
I am the entertainer, and I know just where I stand
Another serenader, and another long-haired band
Today, I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
And I won't be here in another year if I don't stay on the charts
