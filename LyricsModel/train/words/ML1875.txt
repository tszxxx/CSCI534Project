Rollin down a long highway out through New Mexico 
Driftin down to Santa Fe to ride a bull in a rodeo 
he be hook on a feelin 
addicted to a natural high 
do not know why it be appealin 
all he know be he be get to ride 
he be addicted to danger 
rule by passion and pride 
to pain and fear he be no stranger 
but he lust need to satisfied 
hook on a eight second ride 
gettin up down in back of the chute 
make that rosin burn 
he be get he spur on the heel of he boot 
he be at the point of no return 
climb over that chute gate he settle down inside 
the tension 's risin 
but he can not wait until they turn that bull outside 
he be addicted to danger 
rule by passion and pride 
to pain and fear he be no stranger 
but he lust need to satisfied 
hook on a eight second ride 
hook on a eight second ride 
hook on a eight second ride
