if I be the sun way up there 
I would go with love most everywhere 
I will be the moon when the sun go down 
just to let you know that I be still around 
that be how strong my love be woh 
that be how strong my love be 
that be how strong my love be baby baby 
that be how strong my love be 
I will be the weeping willow drow in my tear 
and you can go swim when you be here 
and I will be the rainbow after the tear be go 
wrap you in my color and keep you warm 
that be how strong my love be darl 
that be how strong my love be baby 
that be how strong my love be woh 
that be how strong my love be 
I will be the ocean so deep and wide 
and catch all the tear whenever you cry 
I will be the breeze after the storm be go 
to dry you eye and love you all warm 
that be how strong my love be baby 
that be how strong my love be now 
that be how strong my love be darl 
that be how strong my love be again now 
that be how strong my love be so deep and wide 
that be how strong my love 
so much to love yes so much to love woh 
there be so much love there be so much love 
anything the sun can do I will do it for you 
any kind of love you want I will be with you
