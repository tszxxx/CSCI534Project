[Verse 1: Mike Hranica &amp; Jeremy DePoyster]
Fall to your knees, accomplishing nothing
Fall to your knees, only to exercise your schedule
Abandon calendar
(What has come with such preaching is loneliness)
Profit: Zero
Achievement: Zero
[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Forward can't be stopped
It just goes to show that some words are useless
It just goes to show that some words are useless
Take all your medals
Take all your ribbons
Take all your awards
Take them, take them back to the ground
[Verse 3: Mike Hranica &amp; Jeremy DePoyster]
Our youth is lost;
A product of the created circumstances
All I can say is "maybe"
(All I can say is maybe this is what I've been expecting all along)
Now's the time of weakness
Now's the time of blood
Perhaps even the whole-hearted had wished for this
[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Now's the time of weakness
Now's the time of blood
And still the time of lions
Push everything
Force everything
[Bridge: Mike Hranica &amp; Jeremy DePoyster]
We've all sung of the end
But who truly understands it?
(All along, all along)
[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Forward can't be stopped
It just goes to show that some words are useless
It just goes to show that some words are useless
Take all your medals
Take all your ribbons
Take all your awards
Take them, take them back to the ground
