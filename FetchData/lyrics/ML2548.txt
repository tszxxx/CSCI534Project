[Verse 1]
Go
Forever falling, Into oblivion
The darkness crawls forward
It engulfs, my will to live
Fear is failure
And this is my motivation
[Verse 2]
Take back what was stolen
Reclaim all that's lost
With virtue, I will rise up from the ruins
[Hook]
Come on
[Chorus]
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am unbroken
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am, unbroken
[Verse 3]
Take back what was stolen
Embrace the cycle
Refuse to turn back now and be led astray
Fear is failure
And this is my affirmation
[Chorus]
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am unbroken
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
Unbroken
[Bridge]
The absence of fear, is the renewal of self
The absence of doubt, breeds desire
If there is truth to face
I will design it
I will not be denied
[Outro]
Unbroken
I will not be denied
I will not be denied
Oh
