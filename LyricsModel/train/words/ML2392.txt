how could you 
you be the river 
pour out of this life 
how could you 
you be the morning bird 
who sang I into life every day 
fly away 
you be the blood of I 
the harvest of my dream 
there be nowhere I can find peace 
and the silence will not cease 
nothing be quite how it seem 
the ghost of my joy 
will not let I be 
if you set I free I will not run 
I will not run 
I will not run
