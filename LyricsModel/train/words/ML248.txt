I love sleep in on Saturdays 
and I love college football game 
I love not act my age 
and good barbecue 
yea I be a fan of Faulkner book 
and anything my mama cook 
small mouthed bass have get I hook on Sunday afternoon 
yes I love good cold beer 
and mustard on my fries 
I love a good loud Honky tonk that rock on Friday night 
and hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know 
honey I love you love the most 
man I love how Redman taste 
Dam I love my Nascar race 
any song sung by George Strait be country at it be best 
yea I love scuff up cowboy boot 
and break tear up jeans 
my 4 wheel drive and 8 point buck 
and rocky road ice cream 
and hell yes I love my dog 
and Jack D in my Coke 
but honey I love you love 
yea I love you love 
I love you love the most
