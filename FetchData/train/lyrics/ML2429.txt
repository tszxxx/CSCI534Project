[Chorus]
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
Long live the party
[Chorus]
Do you care, what you are
Where's your pride
We don't know
But we don't wonder why
[Chorus]
The conquest will survive
[Interlude]
The more that you can give it, then the more it will be
And if you do not have it, you can take it from me
All we ever wanted was a thing to believe
And now that we have found it, we have all that we need
[Interlude]
We have found our pride
