these metal head 
the market research 
they be so fond of that 
those beady eye 
the velvet tea cup 
the arm on the map 
I will never know just what i be do 
I will never know what be it 
I never know what be wrong with you you know 
it feel so bad 
the foreign film 
the skin and matter 
the thought on the shelf 
the level head 
the endless shovel 
the fat on the lap 
I feel so bad 
yet it seem so right 
you point out every mistake and complain every night 
I will never know just what I be screw 
I will never know what be it 
I never know what be wrong with you you know 
it feel so bad
