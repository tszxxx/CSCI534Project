offend by my obscenity 
mouth full of soap 
cleanse I 
ask for a little empathy 
mouth be stain please let I 
breathe 
do not breathe do not breathe 
I can not breathe 
breathe 
do not breathe do not breathe 
I can not breathe 
I be suffocate 
I be suffocate 
I be suffocate 
I be so frustrated 
drow in my insecurity 
I be on my hand and knee 
beg for a little symapthy 
beg you to help I 
breathe 
do not breathe do not breathe 
I can not breathe 
breathe 
do not breathe do not breathe 
I can not breathe 
I be suffocate 
I be suffocate 
I be suffocate 
I be so frustrated
