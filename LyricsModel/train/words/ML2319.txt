listen when I say 
when I say it be real 
real life go undefined 
why must you be so miserable 
everything you take 
make I more unreal 
real line be undefined 
how can this be so miserable 
under the summer rain 
I burn away 
under the summer rain 
you turn away 
listen I can not make 
make a sound or feel 
feel fine I kiss the lie 
why must they be so kissable 
listen as I break 
break the four wall seal 
gorgeous eye shine suicide 
when will we be invisible 
under the summer rain 
I burn away 
under the summer rain 
we burn away 
under the summer rain 
I burn away 
under the summer rain 
you turn away 
this be the fall 
this be the long way down 
and we life look smaller now 
and we life look so small 
this be the fall 
this be the long way down 
and we life look smaller now 
and we life look so small 
under the summer rain 
I burn away 
under the summer rain 
we burn away 
under the summer rain 
I burn away 
under the summer rain 
we burn away 
under the summer rain 
I burn away 
under the summer rain 
you turn away
