come ride with I 
through the vein of history 
I will show you a god 
who fall asleep on the job 
and how can we win 
when fool can be king 
do not waste you time 
or time will waste you 
no one be go to take I alive 
the time have come to make thing right 
you and I must fight for we rights 
you and I must fight to survive 
no one be go to take I alive 
the time have come to make thing right 
you and I must fight for we rights 
you and I must fight to survive 
no one be go to take I alive 
the time have come to make thing right 
you and I must fight for we rights 
you and I must fight to survive
