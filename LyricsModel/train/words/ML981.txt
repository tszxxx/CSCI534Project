can you hear they 
the helicopter 
I be in New York 
no need for word now 
we sit in silence 
you look I 
in the eye directly 
you meet I 
I think it be wednesday 
the evening 
the mess we be in and 
the city sun set over I 
night and day 
I dream of 
make love 
to you now baby 
Love- making 
on- screen 
impossible dream 
and I have see 
the sunrise 
over the river 
the freeway 
remind 
of this mess we be in and 
what be you want 
I just want to say 
do not ever change now baby 
and thank you 
I do not think we will meet again 
and you must leave now 
before the sun rise over the skyscraper 
and the city landscape come into be 
sweat on my skin 
oh this mess be in
