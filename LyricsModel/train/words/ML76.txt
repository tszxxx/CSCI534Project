I think you be go to feel you belong 
a nocturnal vacation

you want to feel at home cause you belong 
welcome to my nightmare whoa whoa oh

we sweat and laugh and scream here 
cause life be just a dream here 
you know inside you feel right at home here 
welcome to my breakdown whoa whoa oh

cause life be just a dream here
