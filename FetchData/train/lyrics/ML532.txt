[Verse 1]
Listen to the music
The sound of the angels
Come and see the child
Who can make you whole
Lying in a manger
Away from harm and danger
[Chorus]
Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh
[Verse 2]
He sent from up above
This special gift of love
More precious than silver or gold
He was sent this holiday
To take our pain away
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Go tell it on the mountain
Shout it from a valley
Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes
Men in every nation
Join the celebration
[Outro]
Way down deep joy
Joy, joy, joy
I've got joy
Way down deep inside my soul joy
Unspeakable joy
Joy in my soul
