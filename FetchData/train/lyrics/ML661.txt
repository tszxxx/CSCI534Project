[Verse 1]
When we go for a little walk
Out on the land
When we're just walking and holding hands
You can take it as a sign of love
When the winds of fate
Keep blowing and we both understand
[Chorus]
Sign of love
It's a sign of love
Sign of love[X2]
[Verse 2]
When we both have silver hair
And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine
You can take it as a sign of love
When I look at you
When I'm looking at you for a long, long time
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
When I first saw you
You were just a girl
And I was a man
While the music played
I watched you dance
[Chorus]
